Type of Asset:
1. Stocks: The paper primarily deals with individual stocks.
2. Stock Indices (ETFs): It also involves ETFs, as it mentions both daily stock excess returns and daily ETF raw returns.
Model Input:
1. Technical: The model uses past returns (close-to-open, open-to-close), which fall under technical data derived from historical price series.
2. History: The inputs are historical time series data, specifically lagged values of stock and ETF returns.
3. Environment: The paper discusses using excess returns, which involves stock returns adjusted by sector ETF returns, incorporating macro-sector effects.
Horizon for Prediction:
• One-step ahead: The paper explicitly mentions that the GAN is used for one-step-ahead forecasts of stock excess returns or raw ETF returns.
Frequency of Predictions:
• Daily: The model operates on daily financial data, predicting one step ahead at the daily frequency.
Type of Output:
• Price with Uncertainty: The model outputs conditional probability distributions of future price returns, which include uncertainty estimates.
Name of Model:
• Fin-GAN: The model used in the paper is called Fin-GAN, a GAN-based architecture adapted with a novel economics-driven loss function.
Comparison of Models:
• The paper compares Fin-GAN to classical time series models like ARIMA and deep learning models like LSTMs. It also introduces variations such as ForGAN, which is trained using binary cross-entropy loss and other custom loss functions to improve the Sharpe Ratio.
How is Probabilistic AI Used?:
1. Probabilistic Output Used: The paper emphasizes using and interpreting probabilistic outputs to estimate uncertainty in forecasts.
2. Aleatoric Uncertainty: Probabilistic outputs are interpreted as estimates of volatility, aligning with aleatoric uncertainty, and the model uses these to improve financial risk measures such as Sharpe Ratios.
Assessment of Uncertainty:
• Yes: The authors do assess the quality of the uncertainty estimates by evaluating the Sharpe Ratios of the strategies based on the probabilistic outputs. The performance is benchmarked against classical methods.
Benchmarking Against Traditional Models:
1. Yes, and it outperforms: The paper demonstrates that Fin-GAN outperforms traditional models like ARIMA and LSTMs in terms of Sharpe Ratios.
Is the Code Disclosed?:
• No explicit mention: There is no explicit mention in the sections available regarding whether the code is disclosed.
Future Research Directions:
The authors mention potential extensions to model joint co-movements of different stocks and suggest that their approach could be adapted to other GAN variants like TimeGAN or COT-GAN for more sophisticated financial forecasting tasks.",,WOS:001153279000001,Conditional Generative Adversarial Network (CGAN),,,Yes and outperforming,"Forecasting GAN (ForGAN), Long Short Term Memory Neural Network (LSTM)",Yes and outperforming,ARIMA,No,,No,,"ARIMA, LSTM",Models are compared,Fin-GAN,y,Yes,"The paper introduces Fin-GAN, a Generative Adversarial Network-based model for probabilistic forecasting and classification of financial time series, producing conditional probability distributions and uncertainty estimates.",10.1080/14697688.2023.2299466,,"November 8, 2024 4:07 PM",Tord Johan Espe,Fixed,,"ARIMA, LSTM, Fin-GAN",,,cGAN,No,,Yes,,,,,

Here is the analysis of the article titled ""Fuzzy Neural Systems for Stock Selection"" by F. S. Wong, P. Z. Wang, T. H. Goh, and B. K. Quek:
Tags and Categorization
• Type of Asset:
    ◦ Individual stocks
• Model Input:
    ◦ Fundamental (e.g., data on company-specific financial metrics like P/E ratio, debt ratio, industry performance)
    ◦ History (utilizes historical stock data for training and rule generation)
• Horizon for Prediction:
    ◦ One-year ahead predictions
• Multi-Step Prediction:
    ◦ No, it appears the model focuses on a single time-step prediction for the following year.
• Type of Output:
    ◦ Predicted stock returns as a numerical value with a rating, which represents an estimated performance metric.
• Probabilistic AI:
    ◦ Yes, the model explicitly incorporates probabilistic components through the use of ""neural gates"" that combine fuzzy logic, Boolean data, and probabilistic data to handle uncertainty.
• Name of Model:
    ◦ Integrated Stock Selection (ISS) system utilizing a FuzzyNet framework with back-propagation neural networks (BPN).
• Comparison/Composition of Models:
    ◦ The system integrates fuzzy neural logic with back-propagation learning; components such as ""FuzzyNet"" and ""neural gates"" provide a structured approach to managing probabilistic data, while the BPN aids in learning and generalization.
• Usage of Probabilistic AI:
    ◦ Probabilistic output is used, though it appears to focus on regularizing and improving predictions rather than interpreting uncertainty types.
• Assessment of Uncertainty Estimates:
    ◦ No explicit assessment of uncertainty quality is reported; the probabilistic elements are used more for improving output credibility than for detailed uncertainty analysis.
• Benchmarking:
    ◦ Not benchmarked against traditional econometric models in this paper.
• Code Disclosure:
    ◦ No mention of code disclosure.

Based on the article ""Improving Stock Price Forecasting Accuracy with Stochastic Multilayer Perceptron"", here is the detailed tagging:

- Type of Asset: Stocks (Inari Amertron Berhad, Kuala Lumpur Kepong Bhd, PPB Group Bhd, and Nestle Bhd, all listed in Bursa Malaysia).

- Model Input:
- Technical (stock prices: opening, closing, highest, lowest, and volume of traded stocks).
- History (historical daily stock prices and volumes over five years).

- Horizon for Prediction: One day ahead.

- Frequency of Predictions: Daily, as the model forecasts the highest stock price one day ahead.

- Type of Output:
- Point prediction (highest stock price).
- Probabilistic features (uncertainty modeled using a stochastic process in the activation function).

- Name of Model:
- MLP (Multilayer Perceptron),
- S-MLP (Stochastic MLP),
- S-MLPT (Stochastic MLP with trainable perturbation factor).

- Comparison of Models:
- MLP is the baseline.
- S-MLP incorporates stochastic elements (Gaussian process in the activation function).
- S-MLPT further optimizes the stochastic elements by training the perturbation factor.
- S-MLPT outperforms S-MLP and MLP in accuracy across most stock counters, though not for all.

- Use of Probabilistic AI:
- Probabilistic output is used and interpreted as aleatoric uncertainty (volatility). The stochastic aspect models volatility using the Yang-Zhang volatility estimator.

- Quality of Uncertainty Estimates: No explicit assessment of the uncertainty estimates' quality.

- Benchmarking against Traditional Models:
- The S-MLP and S-MLPT outperform the baseline MLP in accuracy.
- No direct comparison with traditional econometric models like ARIMA or GARCH.

- Future Research:
- Apply S-MLP and S-MLPT models in portfolio optimization.
- Investigate the models' performance in non-financial domains like climate forecasting.

The article you uploaded, titled ""Research on optimization strategy of futures hedging dependent on market state"", discusses the use of a state-dependent hedging model that integrates a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) with various machine learning models to predict market states and optimize hedging strategies, particularly in the crude oil futures market.

Here’s a breakdown of its characteristics based on your required tags:

### Asset Type:
- Commodities: The paper focuses specifically on crude oil futures hedging.

### Model Input:
- Technical: Uses historical price data (both spot and futures prices) and applies technical indicators to predict future states.
- Environment: The model incorporates external macroeconomic factors, such as exchange rates, economic uncertainty, and geopolitical risks.

### Horizon for Prediction:
- Predictions are conducted for various horizons, with the paper evaluating performance across multiple timeframes, including short (5 days) and long (up to months) intervals.

### Frequency of Predictions:
- The model allows for rolling one-step-ahead predictions, where the forecast is dynamically updated based on new data.

### Type of Output:
- The model outputs state predictions (upward or downward markets) and is used to adjust the hedging ratio in futures contracts, aiming to maximize return-to-risk ratios.

### Probabilistic AI:
- Yes: The combination of HMM and machine learning is probabilistic, as HMM captures transition probabilities between market states, and the results are used to adjust hedging positions.

### Models Used:
- The article integrates HMM with various machine learning models, including:
- Random Forest (RF)
- Gradient Boosting Decision Tree (GBDT)
- XGBoost
- LightGBM

These models are compared based on their ability to predict market states and improve hedging efficiency.

### How Probabilistic AI is Used:
- Probabilistic output is used but not interpreted: The probabilistic outputs from HMM are used to adjust hedge ratios based on predicted market states, but there is no discussion of interpreting uncertainty in a formal risk measurement context (e.g., volatility or VaR).

### Uncertainty Estimates:
- The quality of uncertainty estimates is not explicitly assessed, but robustness tests of the model's performance are conducted across different market conditions and volatility models.

### Benchmarking Against Traditional Models:
- Yes, and it outperforms: The paper benchmarks the proposed state-dependent hedging strategy against traditional model-driven strategies, demonstrating that it improves the return-to-risk ratio.

### Code Disclosure:
- The paper does not mention code disclosure.

### Future Research:
- The paper suggests further research could explore different market factors and apply the state-dependent hedging strategy to other financial markets or asset types.

Here is a summary with tagging for the article ""Foreign Exchange Market Prediction with Multiple Classifiers"" by Bo Qian and Khaled Rasheed.
Tags and Summary:
• Type of Asset: Forex (USD/GBP exchange rate)
• Model Input:
    ◦ Technical: The model uses historical exchange rate data, leveraging daily returns to predict direction.
    ◦ History: Data from previous returns are fed into classifiers.
• Prediction Horizon: One-day ahead (predicting next day’s price movement direction)
• Multi-Step Prediction: No multi-step prediction; each model aims at a single time-step ahead (one-day prediction).
• Type of Output: Directional classification (up or down movement)
• Probabilistic Nature:
    ◦ The model primarily combines classifiers, including Naive Bayes, which generates probabilistic outputs, though these are not calibrated for financial probability quality.
• Model(s) Used:
    ◦ Ensemble of Artificial Neural Network, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, and Naive Bayesian Classifier.
    ◦ Ensemble methods include voting and stacked generalization.
• Model Comparison or Composition:
    ◦ Models are compared and composed into an ensemble to improve prediction accuracy. Consistent voting improved accuracy significantly.
• Use of Probabilistic AI: Probabilistic output is not directly used in terms of uncertainty quantification. The probabilistic classifier is applied to optimize ensemble prediction rather than refine probabilistic estimates of market movements.
• Assessment of Uncertainty Quality: No dedicated assessment of the uncertainty quality.
• Benchmarking:
    ◦ No explicit mention of benchmarking against traditional econometric models.
• Code Disclosure: Yes, the MATLAB code is made available for download.
• Future Research Directions:
    ◦ Future work could involve reducing classifier correlation or improving ensemble methods for more robust financial market predictions. Authors also suggest further study into dynamic models that adapt to changing market conditions.
Summary
This study investigates the predictability of the USD/GBP exchange rate using an ensemble of machine learning classifiers (ANN, Decision Tree, kNN, Naive Bayes). By selecting data periods with higher Hurst exponents, they improve model accuracy in periods of greater market predictability. Ensemble methods such as simple voting, stacking, and a ""consistent voting"" approach, which requires unanimous agreement among classifiers, achieve up to 67% accuracy. Despite high classifier correlation reducing ensemble effectiveness, consistent voting outperforms individual models.’",,02776693,Naive Bayes,"Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Decision tree, k-nearest neighbour",,,,,,,,,,,,,y,Yes,"The article investigates the predictability of foreign exchange rates using multiple machine learning classifiers, achieving up to 67% prediction accuracy, thereby challenging the efficient market hypothesis.",,"The article uses Naive Bayes as the probabilistic model, we have not included Naive Bayes as a model that provides naturally good probabiltiies.

The paper titled Classical and Bayesian Analysis of Univariate and Multivariate Stochastic Volatility Models by Roman Liesenfeld and Jean-François Richard offers a comprehensive study of both univariate and multivariate stochastic volatility (SV) models. Below is a structured tagging based on your request:
Type of Asset:
• Forex: The paper explicitly analyzes data related to exchange rates between Deutsche Mark (DM), British Pound (BP), Swiss Franc (SF), Japanese Yen (YEN), and the US dollar.
Model Input:
• History: The model's input includes past values of the returns series, as stochastic volatility models rely on historical volatility patterns.
Horizon for Prediction:
• The paper does not specify a distinct time horizon for predictions, but SV models generally predict the next time step (e.g., day in this case of daily exchange rates) based on past data.
Does the Model Predict More than One Time Step Ahead?:
• The model focuses on one-step-ahead predictions, as it uses a recursive approach where volatility and returns are modeled based on the previous time step.
Type of Output:
• Price with Uncertainty: The SV models output returns with their associated volatility, capturing uncertainty in the form of stochastic volatility.

The document Estimation of Dynamic Bivariate Mixture Models compares two estimation approaches for bivariate mixture models used in financial time series, particularly involving stock price volatility and trading volume. Here's how it aligns with your tagging criteria:
Type of Asset:
• Stock indices (specifically, the Nikkei 225 stock index futures are mentioned).
Model Input:
• History: The model relies on past values of the time series, as it includes a serially correlated latent variable (the number of price-relevant information arrivals) driving stock price volatility and trading volume.
• Technical: Since the model relates to stock price volatility and trading volume, it likely uses time-series data in technical indicators, though not explicitly mentioned.
Horizon for Prediction:
The model doesn't focus on a specific horizon for prediction in the document, but it is applied to daily data over a multi-year period, implying a short-term to mid-term horizon (daily to a few days).
Frequency of Predictions:
Not directly mentioned, but as the model works with daily returns and trading volume, the frequency of predictions is likely daily.
Type of Output:
• The model outputs stock price volatility and trading volume, which are continuous variables. There is no categorization, and probabilities are used in the estimation process.
• The output includes uncertainty estimates since the models involve probabilistic approaches like Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) and Efficient Importance Sampling (EIS).
Probabilistic AI Use:
• Probabilistic output is used and interpreted as aleatoric uncertainty (volatility): The model uses the latent process to describe stock price volatility, accounting for the inherent randomness (aleatoric uncertainty).
Assessment of Uncertainty:
• Yes: The paper assesses the quality of uncertainty estimates by comparing different estimation methods (MCMC vs. EIS), checking the accuracy and convergence of the algorithms.
Model Benchmarking:
• Yes, and it outperforms: The EIS-based maximum likelihood estimation is shown to be more accurate and efficient compared to the MCMC approach initially used by Watanabe.
Code Disclosure:
• There is no explicit mention of code disclosure in the provided text.
Future Research:
The paper suggests further exploration of the EIS algorithm's capability as a robust alternative to MCMC for high-dimensional financial models, indicating potential future work on implementing these models in different contexts or with improved algorithms.",⭐,WOS:000185922400015,,,,,,Yes but unclear which is best,,,,,,MCMC,Models are compared,EIS,y,Yes,"Compares Bayesian MCMC approach with maximum likelihood approach for estimating dynamic bivariate mixture models related to stock price volatility and trading volume, finding importance sampling accurate.",10.1198/073500103288619287,"I am not sure if this is actually AI or machine learning when I read it a second time, it uses MCMC just for paramater estimation, and I think Bivariate Mixture Models and Stochastic Volatility is econometric models","October 18, 2024 9:04 AM",Sivertae,Not started,,"MCMC, EIS",,,,,,No,,,,,

The article ""Dynamic forecasting performance and liquidity evaluation of financial market by Econophysics and Bayesian methods"" presents a study focusing on asset price forecasting and market liquidity assessment using probabilistic models. Below is a categorization based on the provided framework:

Type of asset:
- Stock indices (Hushen 300 or CSI 300 Index, a major stock market index in China).

Model input:
- History (past time series data from asset prices is used to predict future movements).
- Technical (realized volatility is calculated from high-frequency data for input).

Horizon for prediction:
- The horizon appears to be daily, based on the rolling sample method (prices are predicted day by day using historical data).

Frequency of predictions:
- Predictions are made daily, with new forecasts generated each day in the rolling window.

Type of output:
- Price prediction is the main focus, and the model outputs estimated asset prices.

Name of model:
- The paper employs multiple models, notably:
1. Agent-Based Model (ABM)
2. Stochastic Model (SM)
3. Simplified Stochastic Model (SSM)
Each of these is combined with two estimation methods (likelihood and Bayesian) for various empirical assessments.

If there are several models:
- The models (ABM, SM, SSM) are compared in their ability to predict asset prices and evaluate market liquidity. The authors evaluate the performance of the eight combinations of models and methods (ABM + likelihood, ABM + Bayesian, etc.).

How is probabilistic AI used in this article?
- The probabilistic output is used in multiple ways. The authors use the model’s probabilistic nature to simulate asset prices and estimate the trading probability (liquidity). The estimated probabilities are interpreted as measures of market liquidity, and there is a link made between liquidity and asset risk.

Do the authors assess the quality of the uncertainty estimate/probability distribution/calculated risk measures?
- Yes. The quality of the predictions is evaluated using loss functions (MAE, MSE, MAPE), superior predictive ability (SPA) tests, and information criteria (AIC, BIC).

Is the model benchmarked against traditional econometric/statistical models?
- Yes, and it outperforms. The paper compares the eight proposed methods with the benchmark GARCH(1,1) model, and the results show that some of the Bayesian methods outperform GARCH in forecasting accuracy.

Is the code disclosed?
- There is no mention in the document of the code being disclosed.

Future research directions:
- The authors suggest improving the estimation of hidden variables, such as the opinion groups in the ABM. They also note the potential for further refining the use of realized volatility and better integrating macro and micro models for liquidity evaluation and asset price forecasting.",,WOS:000729809800019,,,,,,Yes and outperforming,,,,,,GARCH,Models are compared,"+ Likelihood or Bayesian method, ABM, SM, SSM",y,Yes,"Analyzes why existing machine learning and deep learning algorithms struggle to accurately predict stock prices, attributing it to the predominance of non-curve-shape features in financial time series data.",10.1016/j.physa.2021.126546,"I dont think this article is not actually ML, but discusses how several linear models can be used.

The article you provided, titled ""Bayesian regularisation neural network based on artificial intelligence optimisation"" by Dingqi Yan et al., proposes a Bayesian-regularised artificial neural network (BR-ANN), optimized using the particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, to predict the Shanghai Composite Index (stock market index).

Here is the requested categorization:

### 1. Type of Asset:
- Stock indices: The study focuses on the Shanghai Composite Index.

### 2. Model Input:
- Technical: The inputs include daily stock data such as opening price, highest price, lowest price, closing price, trading number, and trading volume.
- History: The model utilizes historical daily stock prices.

### 3. Horizon for Prediction:
- One day ahead: The model is designed to predict the next day’s closing price of the index.

### 4. Frequency of Predictions:
- Daily: The model predicts closing prices for each day in the time series.

### 5. Type of Output:
- Price: The model outputs a point estimate of the next day’s closing price.

### 6. Name of Model:
- Bayesian regularisation neural network (BR-ANN) optimized by Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO).

### 7. Model Comparison:
- The paper compares the BR-ANN model with other models such as Support Vector Machines (SVM), a modified BP neural network, and a fusion model combining Hidden Markov Models (HMM), artificial neural networks (ANN), and genetic algorithms (GA).
- The PSO-optimized BR-ANN is shown to perform better than the baseline BR-ANN and the other models in predicting stock prices.

### 8. Probabilistic AI Use:
- Probabilistic output is not used: Although the network uses Bayesian regularisation, the output is a point estimate, and the probabilistic aspects are used mainly for regularization to prevent overfitting.

### 9. Quality of Uncertainty Estimates:
- No: The paper does not assess the quality of uncertainty estimates or probability distributions since the focus is on point predictions.

### 10. Benchmark Against Traditional Models:
- Yes, and it outperforms: The BR-ANN model, particularly when optimized with PSO, outperforms the traditional models and other machine learning models such as the SVM and fusion models.

### 11. Potential Areas for Future Research:
- Future work could explore improving the global search ability of the Bayesian neural network and optimizing local maximum predictions, potentially by enhancing the PSO optimization process.

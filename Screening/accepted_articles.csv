WOS:000889065800003,A Bayesian analysis based on multivariate stochastic volatility model: evidence from green stocks,"Green stocks are companies environmental protective and friendly. We test Green stock index in Shanghai Stock Exchange and China Securities Index as safe-havens for global investors. Suitable multivariate-SV model and Bayesian method are used to estimate the spillover effect between different assets among local and global markets. We choose multivariate volatility model because it can efficiently simulate the spillover effect by using machine learning MCMC method. The results show that the Environmental Protection Index (EPI) of Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and China Securities Index (CSI) have no significant volatility spillover from Shanghai Stock index, S &P index, gold price, oil future prices of USA and China. During COVID-19 pandemic, we find Green stock index is a suitable safe-haven with low volatility spillover. Green stock indexes has a strongly one-way spillover to the crude oil future price. Environmentally friendly investor can use diversity green assets to provide a low risk investment portfolio in EPI stock market. The DCGCt-MSV model using machine learning of MCMC method is accurate and outperform others in Bayes parameter estimation.",10.1007/s10878-022-00936-0,Green stock; Spillover Effect; Machine learning; Markov chain Monte Carlo; Bayesian analysis,WOS,"Employs Bayesian multivariate stochastic volatility models to analyze and predict volatility in green stock indices, demonstrating their suitability as safe-haven assets with low volatility spillover.",✔️,Green Stock Indices,✔️,✔️,y,2024-09-24T14:36:28.478841,Tord
10.48048/tis.2022.3045,A Gaussian Process Regression Model for Forecasting Stock Exchange of Thailand,"A stock price index measures the change in several share prices, which can describe the market and assist investors in deciding on a specific investment. Thus, foreseeing the stock price index benefits investors in creating a better investment strategy. However, forecasting the stock price index can be challenging due to its non-linearity, non-stationary and high uncertainty. Gaussian process regression (GPR) is an attractive and powerful approach for prediction, especially when the data fluctuates over time with fewer restrictions. Besides, the GPR gains advantages over other forecasting techniques as it can offer predictions with uncertainty to provide margin errors. In this study, we evaluate the use of GPR to predict the stock price of Thailand (SET). The SET data are divided into 2 datasets; the data in the year 2015-2020 and the data in the year 2020 due to the massive change during the COVID-19 pandemic. The prediction results from the GPR are then compared to the machine learning approaches, artificial neural network (ANN) and recurrent neural network (RNN) using evaluation scores; the root mean square error (RMSE), the mean absolute error (MAE), the mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) and the Nash-Sutcliffe efficiency (NSE). The results indicate that the GPR is superior to the ANN and RNN for both datasets as it provides a high prediction accuracy. Moreover, the results suggest that the GPR is less sensitive to the number of input lags in the model. Therefore, the GPR is more favorable for the prediction of SET than the ANN and RNN. © 2022, Walailak University.

https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9448324,A Hybrid Approach of Bayesian Structural Time Series With LSTM to Identify the Influence of News Sentiment on Short-Term Forecasting of Stock Price,"In the financial sector, the stock market and its trends are highly volatile in nature. Recent studies have shown that news articles and social media analysis can have an immense impact on investors’ opinion toward financial markets. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between news sentiment and stock market movement using information from different news agencies, business magazines, and financial portals. This study offers an application of the Bayesian structural time (BST) series model that is more transparent and facilitates better handling of uncertainty than the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the vector autoregression (VAR) method by using prior information about the structure of the model. One of the main pitfalls of this model is the presumption of linearity. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model is a nonlinear model that can capture various nonlinear structures present in the data set. We propose a hybrid model, which combines the LSTM model with the BST model along with the regression component that captures information from different news sources to identify market predictors. The proposed model detects unusual behavior or anomalous pattern of the stock price movement, which makes our model superior compared to the traditional methods. Our new hybrid model accumulates error with lower rates (3.5%) and shows a remarkable performance over some of the other existing hybrid models, such as AR-MLP, ARIMA-LSTM, and VAR-LSTM model.",10.1109/tcss.2021.3073964,Predictive models;Mathematical model;Data models;Market research;Stock markets;Time series analysis;Logic gates;Anomaly detection;state-space time series model;stock forecasting;text mining;unsupervised learning,IEEE,"The paper presents a hybrid Bayesian Structural Time Series and LSTM model to incorporate news sentiment data for short-term stock price forecasting, achieving lower error rates and improved performance.",✔️,Stocks,✔️,✔️,y,2024-09-25T14:27:01.998244,Tord
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9745535,A Hybrid Prediction Model Integrating GARCH Models With a Distribution Manipulation Strategy Based on LSTM Networks for Stock Market Volatility,"Accurate prediction of volatility is one of the most important tasks in financial decision making. Recently, the hybrid models integrating artificial neural networks with GARCH-type models have been developed, and performance gains from the models have been found to be outstanding. However, there have been few studies of hybrid models considering the nature of the distribution of financial data. Distribution of volatility time-series is highly concentrated near zero, and such aspect can cause low prediction performance on the whole domain of probability density function because weights in the networks can be trained to obtain accurate prediction only for the high frequency region, that is, near zero. To overcome the challenge, we propose a new hybrid model with GARCH-type models based on a novel non-linear filtering method to mitigate concentration property of volatility. For the filtering, we utilize root-type functions that transform extremely left-biased and pointed distribution of original volatility to a volume-upped (VU) distribution shifted to the right. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed as the basic implementation model, and the realized volatility of S&P 500 is predicted using the proposed models. It is found that the proposed hybrid model (VU-GARCH-LSTM) obtains 21.03% performance gain with respect to the root mean square error (RMSE) against the mean performances of the existing hybrid models integrating LSTM with GARCH-type models. Furthermore, the proposed model improves prediction performance in the right domain region of label probability density by making the prediction distribution comparable to the label distribution.",10.1109/access.2022.3163723,Predictive models;Data models;Stock markets;Stochastic processes;Recurrent neural networks;Stock market volatility;long short-term memory;GARCH models;distribution manipulation,IEEE,"The study develops a hybrid model integrating GARCH and LSTM networks with distribution manipulation for predicting stock market volatility, achieving significant performance improvements.",✔️,Stock market volatility,✔️,✔️,y,2024-09-25T12:33:25.499308,Tord
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138772,A Latent Factor-Based Bayesian Neural Networks Model in Cloud Platform for Used Car Price Prediction,"The selling price of a used car can be predicted based on its historical information. Accurate and reasonable used car price evaluation will be able to promote the healthy progress of the used car industry. Current used car price prediction models are troubled by data quality and the inability to provide estimates of uncertain information, and the prediction accuracy cannot meet the needs of real-world scenarios. In this work, we propose a price prediction model based on a Bayesian neural networks with latent factor (LFBNN) in a cloud platform, which is capable of performing latent factor extraction operations on structured data of used cars as a way to remove the effect of noise in the dataset on the model performance. Moreover, the weight parameters of the Bayesian neural networks (NNs) are represented as probability distributions, which is equivalent to introducing uncertainty and acting as a regularization effect compared to a NN with fixed weights, thus making it possible to alleviate the overfitting problem. The LFBNN model uses a cloud platform for data transmission and storage, enabling it to run faster. Compared with the current benchmark models, the model proposed in this work achieves excellent experimental results on two real datasets. The experimental results on the $Car_{1}$ dataset are 1.498 for mse, 1.224 for rmse, and 0.995 for MAE, and 1.519 for mse, 1.232 for rmse, and 1.002 for MAE on the $Car_{2}$ dataset.",10.1109/tem.2023.3270301,Automobiles;Predictive models;Bayes methods;Artificial neural networks;Data models;Data mining;Mathematical models;Bayesian neural networks (NNs);latent factor;price prediction model;used car,IEEE,"Implements a Commitment Machine metaheuristic to adaptively select and combine Expected Shortfall estimation methods using machine learning, enhancing financial risk assessment.",✔️,Portfolio Expected Shortfall,✔️,✔️,y,2024-09-24T15:46:39.419325,Tord
WOS:001140460100001,A Novel Deterministic Probabilistic Forecasting Framework for Gold Price with a New Pandemic Index Based on Quantile Regression Deep Learning and Multi-Objective Optimization,"The significance of precise gold price forecasting is accentuated by its financial attributes, mirroring global economic conditions, market uncertainties, and investor risk aversion. However, predicting the gold price is challenging due to its inherent volatility, influenced by multiple factors, such as COVID-19, financial crises, geopolitical issues, and fluctuations in other metals and energy prices. These complexities often lead to non-stationary time series, rendering traditional time series modeling methods inadequate. Our paper presents a multi-objective optimization algorithm that refines the interval prediction framework with quantile regression deep learning in response to this issue. This framework comprehensively responds to gold's financial market dynamics and uncertainties with a screening process of various factors, including pandemic-related indices, geopolitical indices, the US dollar index, and prices of various commodities. The quantile regression deep-learning models optimized by multi-objective optimization algorithms deliver robust, interpretable, and highly accurate predictions for handling non-linear relationships and complex data structures and enhance the overall predictive performance. The results demonstrate that the QRBiLSTM model, optimized using the MOALO algorithm, delivers excellent forecasting performance. The composite indicator AIS reaches -15.6240 and -11.5581 at 90% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. This underscores the model's high forecasting accuracy and its potential to provide valuable insights for assessing future trends in gold prices. The deterministic and probabilistic forecasting framework for gold prices captures the market dynamics with the new pandemic index and comprehensively sets a new benchmark for predictive modeling in volatile market commodities like gold.",10.3390/math12010029,gold price forecasting; quantile regression; probabilistic prediction models; feature screening; multi-objective optimization algorithms,WOS,"Proposes a manifold learning-based framework with regression models to forecast high-dimensional time series, applied to foreign exchange rates.",✔️,Foreign Exchange Rates,✔️,❌,y,2024-09-25T14:03:32.725682,Tord
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=5356151,A Stochastic HMM-Based Forecasting Model for Fuzzy Time Series,"Recently, fuzzy time series have attracted more academic attention than traditional time series due to their capability of dealing with the uncertainty and vagueness inherent in the data collected. The formulation of fuzzy relations is one of the key issues affecting forecasting results. Most of the present works adopt IF-THEN rules for relationship representation, which leads to higher computational overhead and rule redundancy. Sullivan and Woodall proposed a Markov-based formulation and a forecasting model to reduce computational overhead; however, its applicability is limited to handling one-factor problems. In this paper, we propose a novel forecasting model based on the hidden Markov model by enhancing Sullivan and Woodall's work to allow handling of two-factor forecasting problems. Moreover, in order to make the nature of conjecture and randomness of forecasting more realistic, the Monte Carlo method is adopted to estimate the outcome. To test the effectiveness of the resulting stochastic model, we conduct two experiments and compare the results with those from other models. The first experiment consists of forecasting the daily average temperature and cloud density in Taipei, Taiwan, and the second experiment is based on the Taiwan Weighted Stock Index by forecasting the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar. In addition to improving forecasting accuracy, the proposed model adheres to the central limit theorem, and thus, the result statistically approximates to the real mean of the target value being forecast.",10.1109/tsmcb.2009.2036860,Stochastic processes;Hidden Markov models;Predictive models;Fuzzy sets;Fuzzy logic;Uncertainty;Atmospheric measurements;Pollution measurement;Time measurement;Information management;Forecasting;fuzzy time series;hidden Markov model (HMM);Monte Carlo method,IEEE,"The paper develops a stochastic hidden Markov model-based forecasting method for fuzzy time series, applying it to weather and exchange rate data, improving forecasting accuracy.",✔️,New Taiwan dollar/USD exchange rate,❌,✔️,y,2024-09-25T14:15:31.344451,Sivert
https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9584890,A Two-Factor Fuzzy-Fluctuation Time Series Forecasting Model for Stock Markets Based on a Probabilistic Linguistic Preference Relationship and Similarity Measure,"An increasing number of scholars have tried to incorporate external factors affecting the disturbance of a time series into their forecasting models. However, these studies only verify the linkage relationship of two or more time series by empirical tests without providing any theoretical explanation. This makes it difficult to choose a linkage time series without using many tests. In this paper, a novel two-factor fuzzy-fluctuation time series (FFTS) forecasting model is proposed based on the probabilistic linguistic preference relationship (PLPR) and similarity measure. It not only proposes the idea of combining external factors with internal potential trends but also explains the linkage mechanism of time series fluctuations from the perspective of behavioral preference. Specifically, the probabilistic linguistic preference logical relationship (PLPLR) is employed to express the fluctuation behavior rule and preference attribute from the history testing dataset. The Euclidean distance or Hamming distance between the “current state” and the left side of training PLPLRs is introduced as a similarity comparison method for the identification of appropriate rules. The proposed model is tested using a traditional time series (e.g., the enrollment of the University of Alabama) to compare its performance with existing models. The model is also employed to forecast realistic stock markets, such as the Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index (TAIEX) and Hang Seng Index (HSI). The performance comparison illustrates the effectiveness and universality of the model.",10.1109/access.2021.3122142,Time series analysis;Forecasting;Linguistics;Fluctuations;Predictive models;Probabilistic logic;Stock markets;Fuzzy-fluctuation time series;forecasting;probabilistic linguistic preference relationship;similarity measurement,IEEE,"Proposes a hybrid model combining GARCH-type models with LSTM networks, using non-linear filtering to adjust volatility distributions, enhancing prediction accuracy for S&P 500 volatility.",✔️,Stock Market Volatility (S&P 500),✔️,✔️,y,2024-09-25T11:08:34.958881,Tord
10.1108/PRR-04-2017-0023,A big data Bayesian approach to earnings profitability in the S&P 500,"Purpose: The impact of volatility crush can be devastating to an option buyer and results in a substantial capital loss, even with a directionally correct strategy. As a result, most volatility plays are for option sellers, but the profit they can achieve is limited and the sellers carry unlimited risk. This paper aims to demonstrate the dynamics of implied volatility (IV) as being influenced by effects of persistence, leverage, market sentiment and liquidity. From the exploratory factor analysis (EFA), they extract four constructs and the results from the confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) indicated a good model fit for the constructs. Design/methodology/approach: This section describes the methodology used for conducting the study. This includes the study area, study approach, sources of data, sampling technique and the method of data analysis. Findings: Although there is extensive literature on methods for estimating IV dynamics during earnings announcement, few researchers have looked at the impact of expected market maker move, IV differential and IV Rank on the IV path after the earnings announcement. One reason for this research gap is because of the recent introduction of weekly options for equities by the Chicago Board of Options Exchange (CBOE) back in late 2010. Even then, the CBOE only released weekly options four individual equities – Bank of America (BAC.N), Apple (AAPL.O), Citigroup (C.N) and US-listed shares of BP (BP.L) (BP.N). The introduction of weekly options provided more trading flexibility and precision timing from shorter durations. This automatically expanded expiration choices, which in turned offered greater access and flexibility from the perspective of trading volatility during earnings announcement. This study has demonstrated the impact of including market sentiment and liquidity into the forecasting model for IV during earnings. This understanding in turn helps traders to formulate strategies that can circumvent the undefined risk associated with trading options strategies such as writing strangles. Research limitations/implications: The first limitation of the study is that the firms included in the study are relatively large, and the results of the study can therefore not be generalized to medium sized and small firms. The second limitation lies in the current sample size, which in many cases was not enough to be able to draw reliable conclusions on. Scaling the sample size up is only a function of time and effort. This is easily overcome and should not be a limitation in the future. The third limitation concerns the measurement of the variables. Under the assumption of a normal distribution of returns (i.e. stock prices follow a random walk process), which means that the distribution of returns is symmetrical, one can estimate the probabilities of potential gains or losses associated with each amount. This means the standard deviation of securities returns, which is called historical volatility and is usually calculated as a moving average, can be used as a risk indicator. The prices used for the calculations are usually the closing prices, but Parkinson (1980) suggests that the day’s high and low prices would provide a better estimate of real volatility. One can also refine the analysis with high-frequency data. Such data enable the avoidance of the bias stemming from the use of closing (or opening) prices, but they have only been available for a relatively short time. The length of the observation period is another topic that is still under debate. There are no criteria that enable one to conclude that volatility calculated in relation to mean returns over 20 trading days (or one month) and then annualized is any more or less representative than volatility calculated over 130 trading days (or six months) and then annualized, or even than volatility measured directly over 260 trading days (one year). Nonetheless, the guidelines adopted in this study represent the best practices of researchers thus far. Practical implications: This study has indicated that an earnings announcement can provide a volatility mispricing opportunity to allow an investor to profit from a sudden, sharp drop in IV. More specifically, the methodology developed by Tan and Bing is now well supported both empirically and theoretically in terms of qualifying opportunities that can be profitable because of the volatility crush. Conventionally, the option strategy of shorting strangles carries unlimited theoretical risk; however, the methodology has demonstrated that this risk can be substantially reduced if followed judiciously. This profitable strategy relies on a set of qualifying parameters including liquidity, premium collection, volatility differential, expected market move and market sentiment. Building upon this framework, the understanding of the effects of persistence and leverage resulted in further reducing the risk associated with trading options during earnings announcements. As a guideline, the sentiment and liquidity variables help to qualify a trade and the effects of persistence and leverage help to close the qualified trade. Social implications: The authors find a positive association between the effects of market sentiment, liquidity, persistence and leverage in the dynamics of IV during earnings announcement. These findings substantiate further the four factors that influence IV dynamics during earnings announcement and conclude that just looking at persistence and leverage alone will not generate profitable trading opportunities. Originality/value: The impact of volatility crush can be devastating to the option buyer with substantial capital loss, even for a directionally correct strategy. As a result, most volatility plays are for option sellers; however, the profit is limited and the sellers carry unlimited risk. The authors demonstrate the dynamics of IV as being influenced by effects of persistence, leverage, market sentiment and liquidity. From the EFA, they extracted four constructs and the results from the CFA indicated a good model fit for the constructs. Using EFA, CFA and Bayesian analysis, how this model can help investors formulate the right strategy to achieve the best risk/reward mix is demonstrated. Using Bayesian estimation and IV differential to proxy for differences of opinion about term structures in option pricing, the authors find a positive association among the effects of market sentiment, liquidity, persistence and leverage in the dynamics of IV during earnings announcement. © 2018, Teik-Kheong Tan and Merouane Lakehal-Ayat.",10.1108/prr-04-2017-0023,Bayesian; Data analytics; Factor analysis; Implied volatility; Machine learning; Structured equation modeling,SCOPUS,"The study utilizes a Bayesian approach to model implied volatility dynamics during earnings announcements in the S&P 500, helping investors strategize to manage volatility risks.",✔️,S&P 500 Options,❌,✔️,y,2024-09-25T14:08:35.866439,Sivert

The problem requires predicting whether a company will deliver an earnings surprise a specific number of days prior to announcement. This problem has been well studied in the literature using linear models. A basic question is whether machine learning-based nonlinear models such as tree induction algorithms, neural networks, naive Bayesian learning, and genetic algorithms perform better in terms of predictive accuracy and in uncovering interesting relationships among problem variables. Equally importantly, if these alternative approaches perform better, why? And how do they stack up relative to each other? The answers to these questions are significant for predictive modeling in the financial arena, and in general for problem domains characterized by significant nonlinearities. In this paper, we compare the four above-mentioned nonlinear methods along a number of criteria. The genetic algorithm turns out to have some advantages in finding multiple ""small disjunct"" patterns that can be accurate and collectively capable of making predictions more often than its competitors.

10.1016/j.neunet.2020.03.022,A fast conformal predictive system with regularized extreme learning machine,"A conformal predictive system(CPS) is based on the learning framework of conformal prediction, which outputs cumulative distribution functions(CDFs) for labels in regression problems. The CDFs output by a CPS provide useful information for users, as they not only provide probability for the events related to the test labels, but also can be transformed to prediction intervals with the corresponding quantiles. Moreover, CPSs have the property of validity since the distributions and intervals they output have statistical compatibility with the realizations. This property is very useful for many risk-sensitive applications such as financial time series forecast and weather forecast. However, as based on conformal predictors, CPSs inherit the computational issue. To build a fast CPS, in this paper, we propose a CPS with regularized extreme learning machine as the underlying algorithm. To be specific, we combine the leave-one-out cross-conformal predictive system(Leave-One-Out CCPS), a variant of the original CPS, with regularized extreme learning machine(RELM), which is named as LOO-CCPS-RELM. We analyse the computational complexity of it and prove its asymptotic validity based on some regularity assumptions. We also prove that the error rate of the prediction interval output by LOO-CCPS-RELM is under control in the asymptotic setting. Experiments with 20 public data sets were conducted to test LOO-CCPS-RELM and the results showed that LOO-CCPS-RELM is empirically valid and compared favourably with the other CPSs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd",10.1016/j.neunet.2020.03.022,Asymptotic validity; Conformal predictive system; Cross-conformal predictive system; Cumulative distribution function; Regularized extreme learning machine,SCOPUS,"The paper proposes a fast conformal predictive system incorporating regularized extreme learning machines to generate probabilistic forecasts and prediction intervals for financial time series, demonstrating validity and performance improvements.",✔️,Financial time series,✔️,✔️,y,2024-09-25T11:49:17.461306,Tord
WOS:000652785100001,A general Bayesian model for heteroskedastic data with fully conjugate full-conditional distributions,"Models for heteroskedastic data are relevant in a variety of applications ranging from financial time series to environmental statistics. However, the topic of modelling the variance function conditionally has not seen as much attention as modelling the mean. Volatility models have been used in specific applications, but these models can be difficult to fit in a Bayesian setting due to posterior distributions that are challenging to sample efficiently. In this work, we introduce a general model for heteroskedastic data. This approach models the conditional variance as a function of any desired covariates or random effects. We rely on multivariate log-Gamma distribution theory to construct priors that yield fully conjugate full-conditional distributions for Gibbs sampling.

The empirical characteristics of the intraday dynamics of chosen assets are gauged using nonlinear modelling tools and tests.

10.3233/IDT-180346,A review and empirical analysis of neural networks based exchange rate prediction,"Financial time series data is very chaotic, noisy, fluctuating and nonlinear as different events have occurred in various time periods. Therefore, it is very challenging for researchers to develop the accurate predictive model. Prediction for Foreign Exchange rate is also a very crucial task for N days ahead prediction because of volatile nature of Foreign Exchange rate data. It is also become highly desirable due to it's role in financial and managerial decision making capacity of any country. A lot of efforts have been done by researchers over many years for the development of efficient models to improve the forecasting accuracy. As a result, various important time series forecasting models have been evolved in literature. From the literature survey we have analyzed that statistical techniques are not able to efficiently predict the Foreign Exchange rate. Hence, different machine learning techniques have been used by many researchers for accurate prediction. Over the years different types of neural network models such as multi - layer perceptron, radial basis function neural network, functional link artificial neural network and integrated model such as auto - regressive integrated moving average models are developed to predict the currency exchange rates of different countries with varying parameters. In this paper, we divide our effort into two parts. In the first part, we have reviewed a few selected models based on neural networks and statistical methods including fundamental and technical aspects of currency exchange rate prediction. In the second part, we have made a thorough and careful empirical study of the models reviewed in part one. Our study reveals that the daily currency exchange rates with multi - layer neural network having Bayesian learning technique produces more accurate results against the multi - layer neural network with back propagation learning technique. Similarly, integrated models of radial basis function neural network and functional link neural networks produce less amount of error in comparison to single radial basis neural networks and functional link neural network models.

WOS:000878568700001,A two-step framework for arbitrage-free prediction of the implied volatility surface,"In this study, we propose a two-step framework to predict the implied volatility surface (IVS) in a manner that excludes static arbitrage. First, we select features to represent the surface and predict them. Second, we use the predicted features to construct the IVS using a deep neural network (DNN) model by incorporating constraints that can prevent static arbitrage. We consider three methods to extract features from the implied volatility data: principal component analysis, variational autoencoder, and sampling the surface. We predict these features using the long short-term memory model. Additionally, we use a long time series of implied volatility data for S&P500 index options to train our models. We find that two feature construction methods (i.e. sampling the surface and variational autoencoders combined with DNN for surface construction) are the best performers in the out-of-sample prediction.

Then the hybrid Copula model is nested in a hidden Markov model (HMM), the risk dependences among banking, insurance, securities and trust industries are analysed, and the Copula-Garch model is constructed for empirical analysis of investment portfolio. Finally, the deep learning Markov model is adopted to predict the financial index. The results show that the mixed Copula model based on HMM is more effective than the single Copula and the mixed Copula models.

WOS:000518042000069,An Improved Probabilistic Neural Network Model for Directional Prediction of a Stock Market Index,"Financial market prediction attracts immense interest among researchers nowadays due to rapid increase in the investments of financial markets in the last few decades. The stock market is one of the leading financial markets due to importance and interest of many stakeholders. With the development of machine learning techniques, the financial industry thrived with the enhancement of the forecasting ability. Probabilistic neural network (PNN) is a promising machine learning technique which can be used to forecast financial markets with a higher accuracy. A major limitation of PNN is the assumption of Gaussian distribution as the distribution of input variables which is violated with respect to financial data. The main objective of this study is to improve the standard PNN by incorporating a proper multivariate distribution as the joint distribution of input variables and addressing the multi-class imbalanced problem persisting in the directional prediction of the stock market. This model building process is illustrated and tested with daily close prices of three stock market indices: AORD, GSPC and ASPI and related financial market indices. Results proved that scaled t distribution with location, scale and shape parameters can be used as more suitable distribution for financial return series. Global optimization methods are more appropriate to estimate better parameters of multivariate distributions. The global optimization technique used in this study is capable of estimating parameters with considerably high dimensional multivariate distributions. The proposed PNN model, which considers multivariate scaled t distribution as the joint distribution of input variables, exhibits better performance than the standard PNN model. The ensemble technique: multi-class undersampling based bagging (MCUB) was introduced to handle class imbalanced problem in PNNs is capable enough to resolve multi-class imbalanced problem persisting in both standard and proposed PNNs.

Literature shows that a single model algorithm usually cannot perform satisfactorily on the foreign exchange (Forex) time series because of the market's complexity. This study develops an algorithm based on two stacked generalization models consisting of four machine-learning models. First, the optimal lags of features are found using the Fisher discriminant ratio and partial autocorrelation function. Second, one stacked model fits the bullish trends, and the other holds the bearish trends resulting from a hidden Markov model. We reinforce the predictive signals of these models by extracting relationships between currency pairs with correlation and mutual information. Lastly, the proposed algorithm constructs a portfolio based on the strength of signals dependent on correlation and mutual information. As a result, this paper compares the performance of the proposed approach with different states of the model and several established benchmarks regarding return and risk metrics. The outcomes show that the proposed model's added features-such as time series clustering, considering a range of inputs, and internal relationships among different assets-can increase its performance in the Forex market.",10.1016/j.gfj.2023.100825,Foreign exchange market; Stacked generalization model; Hidden Markov model; Time series forecasting; Time series clustering,WOS,"An algorithmic trading system utilizing stacked generalization models and hidden Markov models is developed for the foreign exchange market, showing enhanced performance in predicting Forex trends.",✔️,Foreign Exchange (Forex),✔️,❌,y,2024-10-15T11:29:11.772374,Sivert

In modern electronically driven markets, traditional time-series econometric methods often appear incapable of capturing the true complexity of the multilevel interactions driving the price dynamics.

A major limitation of conventional deep learning is uncertainty quantification in predictions which affect investor confidence. Bayesian neural networks feature Bayesian inference for providing inference (training) of model parameters that provides a rigorous methodology for uncertainty quantification in predictions. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods have been prominent in implementing inference of Bayesian neural networks; however certain limitations existed due to a large number of parameters and the need for better computational resources. Recently, there has been much progress in the area of Bayesian neural networks given the use of Langevin gradients with parallel tempering MCMC that can be implemented in a parallel computing environment. The COVID-19 pandemic had a drastic impact in the world economy and stock markets given different levels of lockdowns due to rise and fall of daily infections.

10.1002/sta4.70001,Bitcoin Price Prediction Using Deep Bayesian LSTM With Uncertainty Quantification: A Monte Carlo Dropout–Based Approach,"Bitcoin, being one of the most triumphant cryptocurrencies, is gaining increasing popularity online and is being used in a variety of transactions. Recently, research on Bitcoin price predictions is receiving more attention, and researchers have investigated the various state-of-the-art machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) models to predict Bitcoin price. However, despite these models providing promising predictions, they consistently exhibit uncertainty, which cannot be adequately quantified by classical ML models alone. Motivated by the enormous success of applying Bayesian approaches in several disciplines of ML and DL, this study aims to use Bayesian methods alongside Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing Bitcoin price and consequently measure the uncertainty of the prediction model. Specifically, we adopted the Monte Carlo dropout (MC-Dropout) method with the Bayesian LSTM model to quantify the epistemic uncertainty of the model's predictions and provided confidence intervals for the predicted outputs. Experimental results showed that the proposed model is efficient and outperforms other state-of-the-art models in terms of root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) and R2. Thus, we believe that these models may assist the investors and traders in making critical decisions based on short-term predictions of Bitcoin price.

WOS:000717914600001,Deep Nonlinear Ensemble Framework for Stock Index Forecasting and Uncertainty Analysis,"Stock index forecasting plays an important role in avoiding risk and increasing returns for financial regulators and investors. However, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, forecasting stock indices accurately is challenging. In this paper, a deep nonlinear ensemble framework is proposed for stock index forecasting and uncertainty analysis.

(2) Enhanced weighted support vector machine (EWSVM) is proposed for forecasting each component that is decomposed, of which the penalty weights are based on the time order and the hyperparameters are optimized using the simulated annealing algorithm. (3) Recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to integrate the forecast of each component into the final point forecast. (4) Gaussian process regression (GPR) is applied to obtain the interval forecast of the original stock index. Two practical cases (Nikkei 225 Index, Japan and Hang Seng Index, Hong Kong, China) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. In terms of the results of point forecasting, the MAE, R-2, MAPE, and RMSE of Nikkei 225 Index are 66.0745, 0.9972, 0.0066, and 80.0381, and those of Hang Seng Index are 79.2145,0.9968, 0.0073, and 96.7740.

Accurately forecasting stock price trends has always been a focal point for many researchers. However, traditional statistical methods for time series prediction still lack accuracy. The existing deep learning-based methods for stock price prediction have significantly enhanced the accuracy of predicting individual stock prices. However, they are not effective in forecasting the probability range of future stock price trends. In this paper, to address these limitations, we propose a novel DeepAR model based on the attention mechanism (DeepARA) for both single-point and probabilistic predictions of stock prices. This enhances the accuracy and flexibility of stock price forecasting. Although the attention mechanism was initially developed for natural language processing, it has now found applications in time series forecasting, including the dynamics of the stock market. Attention allocates different weights to time points of varying importance, thereby enhancing the model’s ability to capture fundamental market dynamics.

https://doi.org/10.1007/s42521-022-00050-0,DeepVaR: a framework for portfolio risk assessment leveraging probabilistic deep neural networks.,"Determining and minimizing risk exposure pose one of the biggest challenges in the financial industry as an environment with multiple factors that affect (non-)identified risks and the corresponding decisions. Various estimation metrics are utilized towards robust and efficient risk management frameworks, with the most prevalent among them being the Value at Risk (VaR). VaR is a valuable risk-assessment approach, which offers traders, investors, and financial institutions information regarding risk estimations and potential investment insights. VaR has been adopted by the financial industry for decades, but the generated predictions lack efficiency in times of economic turmoil such as the 2008 global financial crisis and the COVID-19 pandemic, which in turn affects the respective decisions. To address this challenge, a variety of well-established variations of VaR models are exploited by the financial community, including data-driven and data analytics models. In this context, this paper introduces a probabilistic deep learning approach, leveraging time-series forecasting techniques with high potential of monitoring the risk of a given portfolio in a quite efficient way. The proposed approach has been evaluated and compared to the most prominent methods of VaR calculation, yielding promising results for VaR 99% for forex-based portfolios.Supplementary InformationThe online version contains supplementary material available at 10.1007/s42521-022-00050-0.",10.1007/s42521-022-00050-0,,Proquest,"Introduces DeepVaR, a probabilistic deep neural network framework for assessing portfolio risk by estimating Value at Risk, demonstrating improved performance during economic turmoil.",✔️,Portfolio,✔️,✔️,y,2024-09-25T11:19:14.658990,Tord
978-1-392-07688-0,Dynamic Machine Learning with Least Square Objectives,"As of the writing of this thesis, machine learning has become one of the most active research fields. The interest comes from a variety of disciplines which include computer science, statistics, engineering, and medicine. The main idea behind learning from data is that, when an analytical model explaining the observations is hard to find—often in contrast to the models in physics such as Newton's laws—a statistical approach can be taken where one or more candidate models are tuned using data.Since the early 2000's this challenge has grown in two ways: (i) The amount of collected data has seen a massive growth due to the proliferation of digital media, and (ii) the data has become more complex. One example for the latter is the high dimensional datasets, which can for example correspond to dyadic interactions between two large groups (such as customer and product information a retailer collects), or to high resolution image/video recordings. Another important issue is the study of dynamic data, which exhibits dependence on time. Virtually all datasets fall into this category as all data collection is performed over time, however I use the term dynamic to hint at a system with an explicit temporal dependence. A traditional example is target tracking from signal processing literature. Here the position of a target is modeled using Newton's laws of motion, which relates it to time via the target's velocity and acceleration.Dynamic data, as I defined above, poses two important challenges. Firstly, the learning setup is different from the standard theoretical learning setup, also known as Probably Approximately Correct (PAC) learning. To derive PAC learning bounds one assumes a collection of data points sampled independently and identically from a distribution which generates the data. On the other hand, dynamic systems produce correlated outputs. The learning systems we use should accordingly take this difference into consideration. Secondly, as the system is dynamic, it might be necessary to perform the learning online. In this case the learning has to be done in a single pass. Typical applications include target tracking and electricity usage forecasting.In this thesis I investigate several important dynamic and online learning problems, where I develop novel tools to address the shortcomings of the previous solutions in the literature. The work is divided into three parts for convenience. The first part is about matrix factorization for time series analysis which is further divided into two chapters. In the first chapter, matrix factorization is used within a Bayesian framework to model time-varying dyadic interactions, with examples in predicting user-movie ratings and stock prices. In the next chapter, a matrix factorization which uses autoregressive models to forecast future values of multivariate time series is proposed, with applications in predicting electricity usage and traffic conditions. Inspired by the machinery we use in the first part, the second part is about nonlinear Kalman filtering, where a hidden state is estimated over time given observations. The nonlinearity of the system generating the observations is the main challenge here, where a divergence minimization approach is used to unify the seemingly unrelated methods in the literature, and propose new ones. This has applications in target tracking and options pricing. The third and last part is about cost sensitive learning, where a novel method for maximizing area under receiver operating characteristics curve is proposed. Our method has theoretical guarantees and favorable sample complexity. The method is tested on a variety of benchmark datasets, and also has applications in online advertising.",,,Proquest,"The thesis explores dynamic and online machine learning techniques, including matrix factorization and nonlinear Kalman filtering, for time series analysis and prediction tasks such as stock price forecasting.",✔️,Stock,✔️,✔️,y,2024-11-01T14:12:28.718719,Tord

For this problem, from the perspective of machine learning, we study the dynamic forecasting and liquidity assessment of financial markets, based on econophysics and Bayesian methods. We establish eight dynamic prediction methods, based on our proposed likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation methods of macro and micro evolution models of econophysics. Combined machine learning thinking and real data, we empirically study and simulate the out-of-sample dynamic forecasting analysis of eight proposed methods and compare with the benchmark GARCH model. A variety of loss functions, superior predictive ability test (SPA), Akaike and Bayesian information criterion (AIC and BIC) methods are introduced to further evaluate the forecasting performance of our proposed methods. The research of out of sample prediction shows that (1) the method of the simplified stochastic model with Bayesian method for only sample return has the best forecasting performance; (2) the method of the stochastic model with Bayesian method for only return samples has the worst forecasting performance. For the liquidity assessment problem, there is a strong correlation between the trading probability evaluated by the proposed eight methods and the real turnover rate, and an increase of liquidity is correspond to the increase of asset risk. In other words, it suggests that all proposed methods can well evaluate market liquidity. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

WOS:000701133500001,Estimation with Uncertainty via Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks,"Conventional predictive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) commonly employ deterministic weight matrices; therefore, their prediction is a point estimate. Such a deterministic nature in ANNs causes the limitations of using ANNs for medical diagnosis, law problems, and portfolio management in which not only discovering the prediction but also the uncertainty of the prediction is essentially required. In order to address such a problem, we propose a predictive probabilistic neural network model, which corresponds to a different manner of using the generator in the conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that has been routinely used for conditional sample generation. By reversing the input and output of ordinary cGAN, the model can be successfully used as a predictive model; moreover, the model is robust against noises since adversarial training is employed. In addition, to measure the uncertainty of predictions, we introduce the entropy and relative entropy for regression problems and classification problems, respectively. The proposed framework is applied to stock market data and an image classification task.

Monte Carlo simulations show that using GMM plus linear forecasts leads to minor losses in efficiency compared to optimal Bayesian forecasts based on ML estimates.

By far the most popular type of neural network has been backpropagation. However, the advantages of other learning techniques such as the swift response of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) suggest the desirability of adapting other models to the predictive function. Unfortunately, the conventional architecture for probabilistic neural networks yields only a bipolar output corresponding to Yes or No; Up or Down. This limitation may be circumvented in part by using a graded forecast of multiple discrete values. More specifically, the approach involves an architecture comprising an array of elementary PNNs with bipolar output. This paper explores a number of interrelated topics: (1) presentation of a new architecture for graded forecasting using an arrayed probabilistic network (APN); (2) use of a ""mistake chart"" to compare the accuracy of learning systems against default performance based on a constant prediction; and (3) evaluation of several backpropagation models against a recurrent neural network (RNN) as well as PNN, APN, and case based reasoning.

In this paper, a Hidden Markov (HM) guided Deep Learning (DL) models has been developed on nonlinear and nonstationary price data of agricultural commodities for forecasting by considering technical indicators viz., Moving Average (MA), Bollinger Bands (BB), Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD), Exponential MA (EMA) and Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT). HM Models (HMMs) can effectively handle the sequential dependencies and hidden states, while DL approach can learn complex patterns and relationships within the price series and thus the drawback of lack of generalization capability in the DL model has been overcome by HMM. In this study, the Potato price data of the Champadanga district of West Bengal, India has been utilized to assess the performance of the proposed technique. HMM has been combined with six baseline DL models viz., Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM), Gated Recurrent Units (GRU), Bidirectional LSTM (BiLSTM) and Bidirectional GRU (BiGRU) for forecast modeling.

By introducing a dimension reduction method which could transform the high-dimensional state vector of high-order HMM into a single one, we present a dynamic high-order HMM trading strategy to predict and trade CSI 300 and S&P 500 stock index for the next day given historical data. In our approach, we make a statistic of the daily returns in the history to demonstrate the relationship between hidden states and the price change trend. Experiments on CSI 300 and S&P 500 index illustrate that high-order HMM has preferable ability to identify market price trend than first-order one. Thus, the high-order HMM has higher accuracy and lower risk than the first-order model in predicting the index price trend. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The proposed approach, denominated ""Commitment Machine"" (CM), has a strong focus on assets cross-correlation and allows to measure adaptively the ES, dynamically evaluating which is the most performing method through the minimization of a loss function. The CM algorithm compares four different ES estimation techniques which all take into account the interaction effects among assets: a Bayesian Vector autoregressive model, Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) numerical schemes with Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), a Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) volatility model and a hybrid method that integrates Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks together with a Monte Carlo approach. The integration of traditional Monte Carlo approaches with Machine Learning technologies and the heterogeneity of dynamically selected methodologies lead to an improved estimation of the ES.

While many new general purpose machine learning approaches have emerged, they remain poorly understand and irreconcilable with more traditional statistical modeling approaches. We present a general class of exponential smoothed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are well suited to modeling nonstationary dynamical systems arising in industrial applications. In particular, we analyze their capacity to characterize the nonlinear partial autocorrelation structure of time series and directly capture dynamic effects such as seasonality and trends. Application of exponentially smoothed RNNs to forecasting electricity load, weather data, and stock prices highlight the efficacy of exponential smoothing of the hidden state for multistep time series forecasting. The results also suggest that popular, but more complicated neural network architectures originally designed for speech processing are likely over-engineered for industrial forecasting and light-weight exponentially smoothed architectures, trained in a fraction of the time, capture the salient features while being superior and more robust than simple RNNs and autoregressive models.

Our approach is based on stochastic equations, the Feynman-Dirac path integral, deep Bayesian networks, and temporal generative adversarial neural networks (t-GAN). The expected financial trajectory is evaluated with a Feynman-Dirac path integral. The latter involves summing all possible financial trajectories that could have been taken by the financial instrument. These trajectories are generated with a t-GAN. A probability is attributed to each point of each path. The probability is a function of the Lagrangian, which is derived from a stochastic equation describing the temporal evolution of the stock. The drift and the volatility at each point, which are required in order to evaluate the Lagrangian, are predicted with a deep Bayesian neural network. Given that the evolution of a stock's price is isomorphic to a time series, our temporal GAN consists of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which introduce a memory mechanism, and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN), which ensure causality.

Especially with the globalization of the world economy and integration of international financial markets, the complex relationships between markets from different countries should be considered in forecasting market trends, involving multi-layered, interactive, evolutionary, and heterogeneous financial variables and the couplings between variable sets from different countries. A variety of methods have been proposed and implemented for forecasting stock market trends, but there is very limited work reported on predicting a market's movement based on analyzing the multi-layered, hidden coupling relationships between various markets in different countries. This involves the analysis of hierarchical coupled behaviors and their relationships across multiple markets, and the nonlinear market dynamics. To address this critical issue, this paper proposes a new approach Multi-layer Coupled Hidden Markov Model (MCHMM) for Hierarchical Cross-market Behavior Analysis (HCBA), namely exploring the complex coupling relationships between variables of markets from a country (Layer-1 coupling) and couplings between markets from various countries (Layer-2 coupling), to forecast a stock market's movements. Toward capturing the hierarchical coupled market behaviors, a Multi-layered Coupled Hidden Markov Model (MCHMM) is built to infer movements of a stock market in a target country by forecasting its price return probabilities.

However, these models only consider the short-term and point-to-point relationships within stock series. The financial market is a complex and dynamic system with many unobservable temporal patterns. Therefore, we propose an adaptive period-aggregation model called the Latent Period-Aggregated Stock Transformer (LPAST).

Additionally, we introduce a self-correlation learning method and routing mechanism to handle complex multi-period aggregations and information distribution.

Markowitz's mean-variance analysis is one of the most well-known and widely adopted techniques for this problem. However, it requires accurate estimations of both the mean and variance of the return, while predicting the variance is particularly difficult. In this article, we propose a novel portfolio selection strategy based on a graph-aware Gaussian process model equipped with generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) likelihood. Our method unleashes the potential of mean-variance analysis by exploiting the Gaussian process model's ability in capturing uncertainty, and the graph information is also incorporated so that correlation among different assets can be utilized. We notice that most existing financial models assume the returns follow the log-normal distribution, whereas we observe that it cannot perfectly explain real-world market data. Based on this discovery, we introduce the GGD as the likelihood function.

WOS:001045509800001,Portfolio optimization using predictive auxiliary classifier generative adversarial networks,"In financial engineering, portfolio optimization has been of consistent interest. Portfolio optimization is a process of modulating asset distributions to maximize expected returns and minimize risks. Despite numerous studies on shallow learning models, they have shown limited success in analyzing the complex nature of massive stock data, a task where recent deep learning models excel. However, the deterministic nature of conventional deep learning models impedes their consideration of portfolio risk due to an inherent lack of uncertainty quantification in their predictions. This paper proposes a novel portfolio weighting strategy, incorporating both risk and return considerations within a deep learning framework. We propose the Predictive Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (PredACGAN), a probabilistic deep learning model, to measure prediction uncertainty. The PredACGAN generator leverages latent vectors and historical stock prices to predict future returns. The model synthesizes predictive distributions from various latent vectors and past prices. The associated risk is produced via the entropy of these distributions, facilitating portfolio optimization through both return and risk considerations. The proposed algorithm removes high-risk assets from the investment universe at rebalancing moments, enabling PredACGAN to optimize portfolios considering both return and risk. We evaluated PredACGAN and the accompanying algorithm with S & P 500 stocks from 1990 to 2020, with portfolios rebalanced monthly based on PredACGAN predictions and risk measures.

Evaluation of competing models such as the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model, and the recurrent neural network (RNN) model with long short term memory (LSTM), in terms of their performances with respect to cumulative one-step-ahead forecast errors with and without sentimental predictors, were carried out. Our contributions are threefold: Firstly, our model is the first one that successfully incorporated the online text mining to an advanced multivariate Bayesian machine learning time series model, which opens the door of applying both text mining and machine learning simultaneously in modern quantitative finance research; Secondly, under the presence of both modern and classical predictors in both fundamental and technical sense, the polarity of news still adds on a complementary effect; Thirdly, we discover that all models under investigation with sentimental predictors do outperform models without these sentimental predictors, and the MBSTS model with sentimental predictors outperforms all the other models. © 2019 [International Journal of Artificial Intelligence].",,Feature Selection; Sentiment Analysis; Text Mining; Time Series Forecast,SCOPUS,"The paper integrates text mining from financial news and Twitter into a Multivariate Bayesian Structural Time Series model to predict stock portfolio prices, outperforming traditional ARIMA and RNN models.",✔️,Stock,✔️,✔️,y,2024-11-01T14:40:29.120978,Tord

Besides being the second-largest digital currency by market capitalization for its cryptocurrency, the Ether (Ξ), it is also the foundation of Web3 and decentralized applications, or DApps, that are fuelled by Smart Contracts. At the time of this writing, Ethereum still uses Proof of Work (PoW) consensus algorithm to ensure the integrity of the blockchain and to prevent double spend. PoW requires the participation of miners, who are incentivized to assemble blocks of transactions by being rewarded with cryptocurrency paid by transaction originators and by the blockchain network itself via newly minted Ξ. Network fees for transaction submissions are called gas, by analogy to the fuel used by cars, and are negotiable. They are also highly volatile and hence it is critical to predict the direction they are heading into, so that one can time transaction submissions, when feasible. There have been several efforts to predict gas prices, including usage of large Mempools, analysis of committed blocks, and more recent ones using Facebook's Prophet model [Taylor, S.

The difficulties in assessing predictability occur due to large heteroscedasticity of errors obtained when predicting several series of different nature and characteristics. In this work, the internal predictability of predictive modeling objects is investigated. Using the example of time series forecasting, we explore the possibility of quantifying internal predictability in terms of the probability (frequency) of obtaining a forecast with an error greater than some certain level. We also try to determine the relationship of such a measure with the characteristics of the time series themselves. The idea of the proposed method is to estimate the internal predictability by the probability of an error exceeding a predetermined threshold value. The studies were carried out on data from open sources containing more than seven thousand time series of stock market prices. We compare the probability of errors which exceed the allowable value (miss probabilities) for the same series on different forecasting models. We show that these probabilities differ insignificantly for different forecasting models with the same series, and hence, the probability can be a measure of predictability. We also show the relationship of the miss probability values with entropy, the Hurst exponent, and other characteristics of the series according to which the predictability can be estimated. It has been established that the resulting measure makes it possible to compare the predictability of time series with pronounced heteroscedasticity of forecast errors and when using different models. The measure is related to the characteristics of the time series and is interpretable. The results can be generalized to any objects of predictive modeling and forecasting quality scores. It can be useful to developers of predictive modeling algorithms, machine learning specialists in solving practical problems of forecasting. © 2023, ITMO University.

While its main appeal is its capability of reproducing any given surface of observed option prices - it provides a perfect fit - the essential component is a latent function that can be uniquely determined only in the limit of infinite data. To (re)construct this function, numerous calibration methods have been suggested that involve steps of interpolation and extrapolation, most often of parametric form and with point-estimate representations. We use probabilistic machine learning to look at the calibration problem in a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian processes. This immediately gives a way of encoding prior beliefs about the local volatility function and a hypothesis model that is highly flexible yet not prone to overfitting. Besides providing a method for calibrating a (range of) point estimate(s), we draw posterior inference from the distribution over local volatility. This leads to a better understanding of uncertainty associated with the model in general, and with the calibration in particular. Further, we infer dynamical properties of local volatility by augmenting the hypothesis space with a time dimension. Ideally, this provides predictive distributions not only locally, but also for entire surfaces forward in time.

In previous work, generative adversarial net-works (GANs) were employed to demonstrate the generation of plausible correlationmatrixes that capture the essential characteristics observed in empirical correlationmatrixes estimated on asset returns. Instead of GANs, we employ variational autoen-coders (VAEs) to achieve a more interpretable latent space representation and toobtain a generator of plausible correlation matrixes by sampling the VAE's latentspace. Through our analysis, we reveal that the VAE's latent space can be a use-ful tool to capture the crucial factors impacting portfolio diversification, particularlyin relation to the sensitivity of credit portfolios to changes in asset correlations. AVAE trained on the historical time series of correlation matrixes is used to generatesynthetic correlation matrixes that satisfy a set of expected financial properties.

These two unknown operators (that can be seen interpreted as dictionaries) and the sequence of hidden states are jointly learnt via an expectation–maximization algorithm. The RDL model gathers several advantages, namely online processing, probabilistic inference, and a high model expressiveness which is usually typical of neural networks. RDL is particularly well suited for stock forecasting.

WOS:000773704100006,Research on HMM-Based Efficient Stock Price Prediction,"Stock market is one of the most important parts of the investment market. Compared with other industries, the stock market not only has a higher rate of return on investment but also has a higher risk, and stock price prediction has always been a close concern of investors. Therefore, the research on stock price prediction methods and how to reduce the error of stock price prediction has become a hot topic for many scholars at home and abroad. In recent years, the development of computer technology such as machine learning and econometric method makes the stock price prediction more reliable. Due to the hidden Markov nature of stock price, this paper proposes a stock price prediction method based on hidden Markov model (HMM). To be specific, since the data of stock price have continuity in time series, it is necessary to extend the discrete HMM to the continuous HMM, and then put forward the up and down trend prediction model based on the continuous HMM. The first-order continuous HMM is extended to the second-order continuous HMM, and the stock price is predicted by combining the prediction method of fluctuation range. As a result, the proposed second-order continuous HMM-based stock price prediction model is simulated on Hang Seng Index (HSI), one of the earliest stock market indexes in Hong Kong. The evaluation results on six months HSI show that the predicted value of the proposed model is very close to the actual value and outperforms three benchmarks in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R-2.",10.1155/2022/8124149,,WOS,"The research introduces a continuous high-order Hidden Markov Model for efficient stock price prediction, outperforming benchmarks in accuracy and error reduction on the Hang Seng Index.",✔️,Stock indices (Hang Seng Index),✔️,❌,y,2024-10-15T11:44:07.756783,Sivert

Traditionally, evaluating portfolio losses in an outer scenario is done by computing a conditional expectation via inner-level Monte Carlo simulations and is computationally expensive. We introduce several inter-related machine learning techniques to speed up this computation, in particular by properly accounting for the simulation noise. Our main workhorse is an advanced Gaussian process (GP) regression approach that uses nonparametric spatial modeling to efficiently learn the relationship between the stochastic factors defining scenarios and corresponding portfolio values. Leveraging this emulator, we develop sequential algorithms that adaptively allocate inner simulation budgets to target the quantile region.

The stock market is a highly complicated nonlinear system which makes it difficult to present accurate predictors. In this paper, an innovative multi-scale nonlinear ensemble paradigm is proposed for stock index prediction and uncertainty analysis, which consists of an optimal feature extraction including variational mode decomposition and auto-encoder, a two-stage deep learning based on recurrent neural network and long short-term memory, and Gaussian process regression. The optimal feature extraction is proposed to extract the optimal features of stock index fluctuations and eliminate the disturbance of illusive components. The two-stage deep learning is developed to conduct the prediction of each feature sub-signal and implement its nonlinear integration. The Gaussian process regression is utilized to construct the interval prediction of the original stock signal and analyze the uncertainties of stock market. The validity of the developed model is verified by the data from S&P 500, Dow Jones index and NASDAQ. After a series of comparisons, the mean absolute percentage errors of the proposed model in S&P 500, Dow Jones index and NASDAQ are 0.55%, 0.65% and 1.11%, respectively. These results fully verify the effectiveness of proposed model. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

WOS:000392285600027,Stock trend prediction based on a new status box method and AdaBoost probabilistic support vector machine,"Stock trend prediction is regarded as one of the most challenging tasks of financial time series prediction. Conventional statistical modeling techniques are not adequate for stock trend forecasting because of the non-stationarity and non-linearity of the stock market. With this regard, many machine learning approaches are used to improve the prediction results. These approaches mainly focus on two aspects: regression problem of the stock price and prediction problem of the turning points of stock price. In this paper, we concentrate on the evaluation of the current trend of stock price and the prediction of the change orientation of the stock price in future. Then, a new approach named status box method is proposed. Different from the prediction issue of the turning points, the status box method packages some stock points into three categories of boxes which indicate different stock status. And then, some machine learning techniques are used to classify these boxes so as to measure whether the states of each box coincides with the stock price trend and forecast the stock price trend based on the states of the box. These results would support us to make buying or selling strategies. Comparing with the turning points prediction that only considered the features of one day, each status box contains a certain amount of points which represent the stock price trend in a certain period of time. So, the status box reflects more information of stock market. To solve the classification problem of the status box, a special features construction approach is presented. Moreover, a new ensemble method integrated with the AdaBoost algorithm, probabilistic support vector machine (PSVM), and genetic algorithm (GA) is constructed to perform the status boxes classification. To verify the applicability and superiority of the proposed methods, 20 shares chosen from Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and 16 shares from National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) are applied to perform stock trend prediction. The results show that the status box method not only have the better classification accuracy but also effectively solve the unbalance problem of the stock turning points classification. In addition, the new ensemble classifier achieves preferable profitability in simulation of stock investment and remarkably improves the classification performance compared with the approach that only uses the PSVM or back-propagation artificial neural network (BPN).

The efficiency and liquidity of the financial market are examined using stochastic models that incorporate information delay. Based on machine learning, we estimate the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting price performances of the six proposed methods using the likelihood function and Bayesian methods, and the out-of-sample prediction performance is compared with the benchmark model ARIMA-GARCH.

At the first step, we embed the high-dimensional time series into a reduced low-dimensional space using nonlinear manifold learning (local linear embedding and parsimonious diffusion maps). Then, we construct reduced-order surrogate models on the manifold (here, for our illustrations, we used multivariate autoregressive and Gaussian process regression models) to forecast the embedded dynamics. Finally, we solve the pre-image problem, thus lifting the embedded time series back to the original high-dimensional space using radial basis function interpolation and geometric harmonics. The proposed numerical data-driven scheme can also be applied as a reduced-order model procedure for the numerical solution/propagation of the (transient) dynamics of partial differential equations (PDEs). We assess the performance of the proposed scheme via three different families of problems: (a) the forecasting of synthetic time series generated by three simplistic linear and weakly nonlinear stochastic models resembling electroencephalography signals, (b) the prediction/propagation of the solution profiles of a linear parabolic PDE and the Brusselator model (a set of two nonlinear parabolic PDEs), and (c) the forecasting of a real-world data set containing daily time series of ten key foreign exchange rates spanning the time period 3 September 2001-29 October 2020.

WOS:000294432100009,Trend forecasting of financial time series using PIPs detection and continuous HMM,"Many machine learning methods in Artificial intelligence literature, such as Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, SVM, and Case-Based Reasoning, have been applied to forecast the financial market with high irregularity and uncertatinty. Among them, SVM is the most representative method that models and forecasts financial time series. However, SVM cannot reflect on the dynamic characteristic of financial time series effectively due to its superior generalization performance. And we cannot guarantee that the parameters of SVM have the optimum values, since they are locally searched owing to the limited time bound. These vulnerabilities are the main factors that degenerates the forecasting performance of SVM. On the other hand, continuous HMM can effectively capture the irregular and dynamic movement of financial time series with a non-stationary property, since it models a financial time series stochastically, rather than deterministically. Therefore, this paper suggests a new method that constructs the trend forecasting model of financial time series. It firstly detects PIPs indicating the significant turnabout of trend in each financial time series. And then the detected PIPs are used to construtct its trend forecasting model based on continuous HMM.

Although some researchers have experimentally demonstrated its ability to make a profit, it is still insufficient to use in real situations because existing studies have failed to answer how risky investment decisions are. Furthermore, even though the objective of PM is to maximize returns within a risk tolerance, they overlook the predictive uncertainty of DNNs in the process of risk management. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called risk-sensitive multiagent network (RSMAN), which includes risk-sensitive agents (RSAs) and a risk adaptive portfolio generator (RAPG). Standard DNNs do not understand the risks of their decision, whereas RSA can take risk-sensitive decisions by estimating market uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Acting as a trader, this agent is trained via reinforcement learning from dynamic trading simulations to estimate the distribution of reward and via unsupervised learning to assess parameter uncertainty without labeled data. We also present an RAPG that can generate a portfolio fitting the user’s risk appetite without retraining by exploiting the estimated information from the RSAs.

10.3390/su16051789,Using Probabilistic Machine Learning Methods to Improve Beef Cattle Price Modeling and Promote Beef Production Efficiency and Sustainability in Canada,"Accurate agricultural commodity price models enable efficient allocation of limited natural resources, leading to improved sustainability in agriculture. Because of climate change, price volatility and uncertainty in the sector are expected to increase in the future, increasing the need for improved price modeling. With the emergence of machine learning (ML) algorithms, novel tools are now available to enhance the modeling of agricultural commodity prices. This research explores both univariate and multivariate ML techniques to perform probabilistic price prediction modeling for the Canadian beef industry, taking into account beef production, commodity markets, and international trade features to enhance accuracy. We model Alberta fed steer prices using three multivariate ML algorithms (support vector regression (SVR), random forest (RF), and Adaboost (AB)) and three univariate ML algorithms (autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA), seasonal ARIMA (SARIMA), and the seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average with exogenous factors (SARIMAX)). We apply these models to monthly fed steer price data between January 2005 and September 2023 and compare predicted prices with observed prices using several validation metrics. The outcomes indicate that both random forest (RF) and Adaboost (AB) show superior overall performance in accurately predicting Alberta fed steer prices in comparison to other algorithms. To better account for the variance of the best model performance, we subsequently adopted a probabilistic approach by considering uncertainty in our best-selected ML model. The beef industry can use these improved price models to minimize resource waste and inefficiency in the sector and improve the long-term sustainability prospects for beef producers in Canada. © 2024.",10.3390/su16051789,Adaboost; ARIMA; Canadian Cattle Price Modeling; machine learning; multivariate and univariate modeling; probabilistic modeling; random forest; SARIMA; SARIMAX; support vector regression,SCOPUS,"Implements machine learning models with Bayesian optimization and Gaussian process regression to forecast flat steel product price indices in China, achieving high forecasting accuracy.",✔️,Flat steel price index,✔️,✔️,y,2024-09-25T10:47:14.971616,Tord
978-1-109-52503-8,Variance-based clustering methods and higher order data transformations and their applications,"Two approaches have been proposed in statistical and machine learning communities in order to address the problem of uncovering clusters with complex structure. One approach relies on the development of clustering criteria that are able to accommodate increasingly complex characteristics of the data. The other approach is based on simplification of structure of data by mapping it to a different feature space via a non-linear function and then clustering in the new space. This dissertation covers three related studies: development of a novel multi-dimensional clustering method, development of non-linear mapping functions that leverage higher-order co-occurrences between features in boolean data, and applications of these mapping functions for improving the performance of clustering methods. In particular, we treat clustering as a combinatorial optimization problem of finding a partition of the data so as to minimize a certain criterion. We develop a novel multi-dimensional clustering method based on a statistically-motivated criterion proposed by J. Neyman for stratified sampling from one-dimensional data. We show that this criterion is more reflective of the underlying data structure than the seemingly similar K-means criterion when second order variability is not homogeneous between constituent subgroups. Furthermore, experimental results demonstrate that generalization of the Neyman's criterion to multi-dimensional spaces and development of the associated clustering algorithm allow for statistically efficient estimation of the grand mean vector of a population. In the framework of the mapping-based approach to discovering complex cluster structures, we introduced a novel adaptive non-linear data transformation termed Unsupervised Second Order Transformation (USOT). The novelties behind USOT are (a) that it leverages in a unsupervised manner, higher-order co-occurrences between features in boolean data, and (b) that it considers each feature in the context of probabilistic relationships with other features. In addition, USOT has two desirable properties. USOT adaptively selects features that would influence the mapping of a given feature, and preserves the interpretability of dimensions of the transformed space. Experimental results on text corpora and financial time series demonstrate that by leveraging higher-order co-occurrences between features, clustering methods achieved statistically significant improvements in USOT space over the original boolean space.",,,Proquest,"The dissertation develops novel variance-based clustering methods and higher-order data transformations, applying them to financial time series data to uncover complex cluster structures and improve data analysis in finance.",❌,?,✔️,❌,y,2024-11-01T14:19:13.708903,Tord
WOS:000891788100011,Volatility index prediction based on a hybrid deep learning system with multi-objective optimization and mode decomposition,"Advances in volatility index prediction based on computational intelligence have brought wide-ranging benefits to financial risk management. However, current studies in the field remain limited and need further improve-ment due to these research gaps: (1) ignoring the important role of probabilistic prediction in characterizing uncertainty risks; (2) relying on single-objective optimization algorithm to optimize prediction model, thereby ignoring the advantages of multi-objective optimization; (3) emphasizing nonlinear modeling, not considering both nonlinear and linear modeling simultaneously. Aiming to address these gaps, a novel multi-objective hybrid deep learning system, composed of a modified multi-objective optimizer, a clockwork recurrent neural network, and an improved mode decomposition method, is newly proposed to perform deterministic and probabilistic volatility index prediction. Concretely, the volatility index is decomposed into some modes using an advanced data decomposition method; further, the clockwork recurrent neural network is considered a prediction engine to model these modes, which has an excellent ability to model the long-term dependency for linear and nonlinear time series depending on its mechanism of temporal granularity, as compared to traditional recurrent neural networks; finally, the prediction results can be obtained by integrating the predictions from these modes, using the mode weights calculated by an improved multi-objective optimizer with the objectives of prediction accuracy and stability.

WOS:001316679800001,Improving Stock Price Forecasting Accuracy with Stochastic Multilayer Perceptron,"The stock market operates in a stochastic environment, making accurate price forecasting challenging. To address this issue, a stochastic multilayer perceptron (S-MLP) model has been developed to simulate the stock market's stochastic nature. By incorporating a Gaussian process into the sigmoid activation function, this model incorporates stochasticity into the traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP). As the perturbation factor, a stochastic sigmoid activation function (SAF) with a volatility estimator is used. Although S-MLP has demonstrated superiority over MLP, there is still room for improvement in terms of forecasting precision. In this study, we propose S-MLP with a trainable perturbation factor (S-MLPT), an improved variant of SMLP. SAF employs the Yang-Zhang volatility estimator as the perturbation factor. The proposed model first employed MLP, and all the parameters were trained. After freezing the parameters, SMLP is used to train the perturbation factor in the SAF. To evaluate the predictive performance of the models, MLP, S-MLP, and S-MLPT are used to predict the one day ahead highest stock price of four counters listed in Bursa Malaysia. As an evaluation metric, the coefficient of determination is utilised, and the relative percentage improvement of the models is calculated to determine their superiority. The results demonstrated that S-MLP outperforms MLP by effectively minimizing the loss function and converging towards a better local or global minimum during training.

The purpose of our study is to comparatively evaluate a plethora of Artificial Intelligence systems in forecasting high frequency Bitcoin price series. We employ three different sets of models, i.e., statistical machine learning approaches including support vector regressions (SVR) and Gaussian Poisson regressions (GRP), algorithmic models such as regression trees (RT) and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and finally artificial neural network topologies such as feedforward (FFNN), Bayesian regularization (BRNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an extensive empirical investigation of the comparative predictability of various machine learning models is implemented in high-frequency trading of Bitcoin. The entropy analysis of training and testing samples reveals long memory traits, high levels of stochasticity, and topological complexity. The presence of inherent nonlinear dynamics of Bitcoin time series fully rationalizes the use of advanced machines learning techniques. The optimal parameter values for SVR, GRP and kNN are found via Bayesian optimization. Based on diverse performance metrics, our results show that the BRNN renders an outstanding accuracy in forecasting, while its convergence is unhindered and remarkably fast.

Often, the support for the nonparametric methods is based on a benchmark such as the Black-Scholes (BS) model with constant volatility. In this paper, we study the stochastic volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility random jump (SVJ) models as parametric benchmarks against feedforward neural network (FNN) models, a class of neural network models. Our choice for FNN models is due to their well-studied universal approximation properties of an unknown function and its partial derivatives. Since the partial derivatives of an option pricing formula are risk pricing tools, an accurate estimation of the unknown option pricing function is essential for pricing and hedging.

WOS:000254056900005,The Markov-switching multifractal model of asset returns: GMM estimation and linear forecasting of volatility,"Multifractal processes have recently been proposed as a new formalism for modeling the time series of returns in finance. The major attraction of these processes is their ability to generate various degrees of long memory in different powers of returns-a feature that has been found in virtually all financial data. Initial difficulties stemming from nonstationarity and the combinatorial nature of the original model have been overcome by the introduction of an iterative Markov-switching multifractal model which allows for estimation of its parameters via maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian forecasting of volatility. However, applicability of MLE is restricted to cases with a discrete distribution of volatility components. From a practical point of view, ML also becomes computationally unfeasible for large numbers of components even if they are drawn from a discrete distribution. Here we propose an alternative generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator together with linear forecasts which in principle is applicable for any continuous distribution with any number of volatility components. Monte Carlo studies show that GMM performs reasonably well for the popular binomial and lognormal models and that the loss incurred with linear compared to optimal forecasts is small. Extending the number of volatility components beyond what is feasible with MLE leads to gains in forecasting accuracy for some time series.",10.1198/073500107000000403,generalized method of moments; Levinson-Durbin algorithm; long memory; multiplicative; volatility model,WOS,"The article introduces a generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator for Markov-switching multifractal models of asset returns, facilitating linear volatility forecasting and demonstrating improved forecasting accuracy through extensive Monte Carlo simulations.",✔️,Asset returns volatility,❌,✔️,tja,2024-10-02T14:33:29.139854,Sivert
WOS:000188597300010,The adaptive selection of financial and economic variables for use with artificial neural networks,"It has been widely accepted that predicting stock returns is not a simple task since many market factors are involved and their structural relationships are not perfectly linear. Recently, a promising data mining technique in machine learning has been proposed to uncover the predictive relationships of numerous financial and economic variables. Inspired by the fact that the determinant between these variables and their interrelationships over stock returns changes over time, we explore this issue further by using data mining to uncover the recent relevant variables with the greatest predictive ability. The objective is to examine whether using the recent relevant variables leads to additional improvements in stock return forecasting. Given evidence of non-linearity in the financial market, the resulting variables are then provided to neural networks, including probabilistic and feed-forward neural networks, for predicting the directions of future excess stock return. The results show that redeveloped neural network models that use the recent relevant variables generate higher profits with lower risks than the buy-and-hold strategy, conventional linear regression, and the random walk model, as well as the neural network models that use constant relevant variables.

WOS:000592318300001,"Time series modelling, NARX neural network and hybrid KPCA-SVR approach to forecast the foreign exchange market in Mauritius","Purpose This study constructs time series model, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and statistical topologies to examine the volatility and forecast foreign exchange rates. The Mauritian forex market has been utilized as a case study, and daily data for nominal spot rate (during a time period of five years spanning from 2014 to 2018) for EUR/MUR, GBP/MUR, CAD/MUR and AUD/MUR have been applied for the predictions. Design/methodology/approach Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models are used as a basis for time series modelling for the analysis, along with the non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) neural network backpropagation algorithm utilizing different training functions, namely, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian regularization and scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) algorithms. The study also features a hybrid kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm as an additional statistical tool to conduct financial market forecasting modelling. Mean squared error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are employed as indicators for the performance of the models. Findings The results demonstrated that the GARCH model performed better in terms of volatility clustering and prediction compared to the ARIMA model. On the other hand, the NARX model indicated that LM and Bayesian regularization training algorithms are the most appropriate method of forecasting the different currency exchange rates as the MSE and RMSE seemed to be the lowest error compared to the other training functions. Meanwhile, the results reported that NARX and KPCA-SVR topologies outperformed the linear time series models due to the theory based on the structural risk minimization principle. Finally, the comparison between the NARX model and KPCA-SVR illustrated that the NARX model outperformed the statistical prediction model. Overall, the study deduced that the NARX topology achieves better prediction performance results compared to time series and statistical parameters. Research limitations/implications The foreign exchange market is considered to be instable owing to uncertainties in the economic environment of any country and thus, accurate forecasting of foreign exchange rates is crucial for any foreign exchange activity. The study has an important economic implication as it will help researchers, investors, traders, speculators and financial analysts, users of financial news in banking and financial institutions, money changers, non-banking financial companies and stock exchange institutions in Mauritius to take investment decisions in terms of international portfolios. Moreover, currency rates instability might raise transaction costs and diminish the returns in terms of international trade. Exchange rate volatility raises the need to implement a highly organized risk management measures so as to disclose future trend and movement of the foreign currencies which could act as an essential guidance for foreign exchange participants. By this way, they will be more alert before conducting any forex transactions including hedging, asset pricing or any speculation activity, take corrective actions, thus preventing them from making any potential losses in the future and gain more profit. Originality/value This is one of the first studies applying artificial intelligence (AI) while making use of time series modelling, the NARX neural network backpropagation algorithm and hybrid KPCA-SVR to predict forex using multiple currencies in the foreign exchange market in Mauritius.",10.1108/ajems-04-2019-0161,Forex market; Time series model; Artificial intelligence; ARIMA; GARCH; ANN; NARX; KPCA-SVR,WOS,"Applies time series models, NARX neural networks, and KPCA-SVR hybrid models to forecast forex rates in Mauritius, finding NARX outperforms others.",✔️,"Forex (EUR/MUR, GBP/MUR, etc.)",✔️,❌,tja,2024-09-25T14:24:23.144119,Sivert

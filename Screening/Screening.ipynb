The purpose of this article is to develop an alternative Bayesian predictive model (two-parameter) which can be used to compute important risk measures that are not defined via the above predictive models. Bayesian predictive density for the Weibull-Pareto composite distribution is developed and is used to compute risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE), Predictive Expectation (PE), Limited Predictive Expected value (LPE), Limited Predictive Variance (LPV), and Limited Predictive Tail-VaR (LPCTE). Accuracy of parameter estimates as well as the risk measures are assessed via simulation studies. It is shown that the informative Bayes estimates are consistently more accurate than ML and the non-informative Bayes estimates. Backtesting for the risk measures is performed and goodness-of-fit of Weibull-Pareto among other composite models to the Danish fire data is assessed.\",\n          \"Reliable prediction of stock indexes can be highly valuable for financial decision-making and risk management. The stock market is a highly complicated nonlinear system which makes it difficult to present accurate predictors. In this paper, an innovative multi-scale nonlinear ensemble paradigm is proposed for stock index prediction and uncertainty analysis, which consists of an optimal feature extraction including variational mode decomposition and auto-encoder, a two-stage deep learning based on recurrent neural network and long short-term memory, and Gaussian process regression. The optimal feature extraction is proposed to extract the optimal features of stock index fluctuations and eliminate the disturbance of illusive components. The two-stage deep learning is developed to conduct the prediction of each feature sub-signal and implement its nonlinear integration. The Gaussian process regression is utilized to construct the interval prediction of the original stock signal and analyze the uncertainties of stock market. The validity of the developed model is verified by the data from S&P 500, Dow Jones index and NASDAQ. After a series of comparisons, the mean absolute percentage errors of the proposed model in S&P 500, Dow Jones index and NASDAQ are 0.55%, 0.65% and 1.11%, respectively. These results fully verify the effectiveness of proposed model. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

This paper proposes an automated capital prediction strategy for the capital supply chain using time series analysis artificial intelligence methods. Firstly, to analyze the fluctuation and tail risk of the financial characteristics, the paper explores the financial characteristics for measuring the dynamic VaR from the perspectives of volatility, tail, and peak with the Bayesian peaks over threshold (POT) model. Following this, in order to make the modeling more refined, the forecast targets are split before modeling with seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Prophet models. Finally, the time series modeling of the wavelet Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is carried out using a two-part analysis method to determine the linear separated wavelet and non-linear embedded wavelet parts to predict strong volatility in financial capital. Taking the user capital flow of the Yu'e Bao platform, the results prove the feasibility and prediction accuracy of the innovative model proposed.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 156,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3001287\",\n          \"10.3233/AIC-200629\",\n          \"10.1016/j.mlwa.2022.100255\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 152,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Stock forecasting; Singular spectrum analysis; Enhanced weighted support vector machine; Deep learning; Nonlinear ensemble\",\n          \"BMSM models; Volatility forecasting; Skewed t innovations\",\n          \"Machine learning; Cryptocurrencies; Technical indicators; Bayesian neural network\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Origin\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"WOS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":8}],"source":["clean_wos_df = wos_df[[\"UT\", \"TI\", \"AB\", \"DI\", \"DE\"]].set_index(\"UT\")\n","clean_wos_df.columns = [\"Title\", \"Abstract\", \"DOI\", \"Keywords\"]\n","clean_wos_df[\"Origin\"] = \"WOS\"\n","clean_wos_df.index.name = \"ID\"\n","clean_wos_df"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"ZJEjsIKnysYo"},"source":["## 1.2 Load results from Scopus\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"id":"GASrYljbysvi","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731071899801,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":4,"user":{"displayName":"Kristoffer Nicolay Broch Grude","userId":"17507872195165455814"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["scopus_file_path = \"drive/MyDrive/Master/Screening/Raw data/scopus.csv\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":930,"status":"ok","timestamp":1731071900728,"user":{"displayName":"Kristoffer Nicolay Broch Grude","userId":"17507872195165455814"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"9qPCfly3ysvi","outputId":"6ef5bfc3-6ace-470c-8c7b-38546919a037"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                        Authors  \\\n","0            Caprioli S.; Cagliero E.; Crupi R.   \n","1    Clintworth M.; Lyridis D.; Boulougouris E.   \n","2                   Kim J.-M.; Han H.H.; Kim S.   \n","3                                 Jin B.; Xu X.   \n","4                  Li Z.; Li C.; Min L.; Lin D.   \n","..                                          ...   \n","208                                      Lux T.   \n","209              Wong F.S.; Wang P.Z.; Teh H.H.   \n","210          Cheng C.-H.; Chen T.-L.; Wei L.-Y.   \n","211                         Kim S.H.; Chun S.H.   \n","212                                     Ward C.   \n","\n","                                     Author full names  \\\n","0    Caprioli, Sergio (58632917500); Cagliero, Eman...   \n","1    Clintworth, Mark (57194013072); Lyridis, Dimit...   \n","2    Kim, Jong-Min (55720212100); Han, Hope H.

The specific tasks of interest here include the detection of tipping points, and the uncertainty quantification of rare events near them. Our illustrative examples are an event-driven, stochastic financial market model describing the mimetic behavior of traders, and a compartmental stochastic epidemic model on an Erd\\u00f6s-R\\u00e9nyi network. We contrast the pros and cons of the different types of surrogate models and the effort involved in learning them. Importantly, the proposed framework reveals that, around the tipping points, the emergent dynamics of both benchmark examples can be effectively described by a one-dimensional stochastic differential equation, thus revealing the intrinsic dimensionality of the normal form of the specific type of the tipping point. This allows a significant reduction in the computational cost of the tasks of interest. \\u00a9 The Author(s) 2024.\",\n          \"We study the problem of the intraday short-term volume forecasting in cryptocurrency multi-markets. The predictions are built by using transaction and order book data from different markets where the exchange takes place. Methodologically, we propose a temporal mixture ensemble, capable of adaptively exploiting, for the forecasting, different sources of data and providing a volume point estimate, as well as its uncertainty. We provide evidence of the clear outperformance of our model with respect to econometric models. Moreover our model performs slightly better than Gradient Boosting Machine while having a much clearer interpretability of the results. Finally, we show that the above results are robust also when restricting the prediction analysis to each volume quartile. \\u00a9 2021, The Author(s).\",\n          \"Accurate information about growing crops allows for regulating the internal stocks of agricultural products and drawing strategies for negotiating agricultural commodities on financial markets. Machine learning methods are widely implemented for crop type recognition and classification based on satellite images. However, field classification is complicated by class imbalance and aggregation of pixel-wise into field-wise forecasting. We propose here a Bayesian methodology for the aggregation of classification results. We report the comparison of class balancing techniques. We also report the comparison of classical machine learning methods and the U-Net convolutional neural network for classifying crops using a single satellite image. The best result for single-satellite-image crop classification was achieved with an overall accuracy of 77.4% and a Macro F1-score of 0.66. Bayesian aggregation for field-wise classification improved the result obtained using majority voting aggregation by 1.5%. We demonstrate here that the Bayesian aggregation approach outperforms the majority voting and averaging strategy in overall accuracy for the single-image crop classification task. \\u00a9 2022 by the authors.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 196,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Adversarial learning; Deep learning; Generative adversarial network; Portfolio management; Probability estima-tion; Risk estimation\",\n          \"Economic growth; Econophysics; Machine learning; Na\\u00efve Bayes classifier; Stock networks\",\n          \"Classification; Deep learning; Feature engineering; Financial time series; Machine learning; Trend prediction\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Origin\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"SCOPUS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":12}],"source":["import numpy as np\n","\n","clean_scopus_df = scopus_df[[\"DOI\", \"Title\", \"Abstract\", \"Author Keywords\"]].copy()\n","clean_scopus_df.columns = [\"DOI\", \"Title\", \"Abstract\", \"Keywords\"]\n","clean_scopus_df[\"ID\"] = np.where(pd.isna(clean_scopus_df[\"DOI\"]), scopus_df[\"EID\"], clean_scopus_df[\"DOI\"])\n","clean_scopus_df = clean_scopus_df.set_index(\"ID\")\n","clean_scopus_df[\"Origin\"] = \"SCOPUS\"\n","clean_scopus_df.index.name = \"ID\"\n","clean_scopus_df"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"3Fk2Hc4R3mzJ"},"source":["## 1.3 Load results from IEE Xplore\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":13,"metadata":{"id":"Esl-fANx3mzK","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731071900728,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Kristoffer Nicolay Broch Grude","userId":"17507872195165455814"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["ieee_file_path = \"drive/MyDrive/Master/Screening/Raw data/ieeexplore.csv\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":14,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":550,"status":"ok","timestamp":1731071901275,"user":{"displayName":"Kristoffer Nicolay Broch Grude","userId":"17507872195165455814"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"s4iueywy3mzK","outputId":"259ffcce-d307-4ac4-ea5a-9375b5aab1ed"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                       Document Title  \\\n","0   Stock Market Trend Prediction Using High-Order...   \n","1   Combining Deep Learning and Multiresolution An...   \n","2   Accurate Stock Price Forecasting Based on Deep...   \n","3   Ensemble Technique With Optimal Feature Select...   \n","4   A Bayesian Learning Method for Financial Time-...   \n","..                                                ...   \n","71  CrowdFAB: Intelligent Crowd-Forecasting Using ...   \n","72  Crop Prediction Based on Characteristics of th...   \n","73                Learning the Information Divergence   \n","74  Predicting IoT Distributed Ledger Fraud Transa...   \n","75  SNoRe: Scalable Unsupervised Learning of Symbo...   \n","\n","                                              Authors  \\\n","0                    M.

This simulation-based method combines particle-filtering technology with a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm when the model is non-linear and the number of observed variables is relatively sparse. We compare the performance of the sequential Bayesian learning approach with the numerical maximum likelihood estimation (NMLE) in estimating models based on S&P 500 return rates. Our research concludes that the sequential parameter learning approach performs more robustly and accurately than the NMLE, by taking into account the uncertainty of the model. We also carry out simulation studies to confirm that the sequential Bayesian learning method is extremely reliable for GARCH models.\",\n          \"Traversing terrain with good traction is crucial for achieving fast off-road navigation. Instead of manually designing costs based on terrain features, existing methods learn terrain properties directly from data via self-supervision to automatically penalize trajectories moving through undesirable terrain, but challenges remain in properly quantifying and mitigating the risk due to uncertainty in the learned models. To this end, we present evidential off-road autonomy (EVORA), a unified framework to learn uncertainty-aware traction model and plan risk-aware trajectories. For uncertainty quantification, we efficiently model both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by learning discrete traction distributions and probability densities of the traction predictor's latent features. Leveraging evidential deep learning, we parameterize Dirichlet distributions with the network outputs and propose a novel uncertainty-aware squared Earth Mover's Distance loss with a closed-form expression that improves learning accuracy and navigation performance. For risk-aware navigation, the proposed planner simulates state trajectories with the worst-case expected traction to handle aleatoric uncertainty and penalizes trajectories moving through terrain with high epistemic uncertainty. Our approach is extensively validated in simulation and on wheeled and quadruped robots, showing improved navigation performance compared to methods that assume no slip, assume the expected traction, or optimize for the worst-case expected cost.\",\n          \"In this paper, we address the chance-constrained safe Reinforcement Learning (RL) problem using the function approximators based on Stochastic Model Predictive Control (SMPC) and Distributionally Robust Model Predictive Control (DRMPC). We use Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to measure the probability of constraint violation and safety. In order to provide a safe policy by construction, we first propose using parameterized nonlinear DRMPC at each time step. DRMPC optimizes a finite-horizon cost function subject to the worst-case constraint violation in an ambiguity set. We use a statistical ball around the empirical distribution with a radius measured by the Wasserstein metric as the ambiguity set. Unlike the sample average approximation SMPC, DRMPC provides a probabilistic guarantee of the out-of-sample risk and requires lower samples from the disturbance. Then the Q-learning method is used to optimize the parameters in the DRMPC to achieve the best closed-loop performance. Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) path planning with obstacle avoidance will be considered to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 75,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Bayes methods;Biological system modeling;Numerical models;Autoregressive processes;Analytical models;Computational modeling;Maximum likelihood estimation;Sequential Bayesian learning;GARCH models;Markov chain Monte Carlo;particle filtering;sparse recovery\",\n          \"Calibration;Elevators;Webcams;Motors;Soft sensors;Q-learning;Feature extraction;Automatic calibration;deep Q-learning;parameter estimation;reinforcement learning (RL)\",\n          \"Stochastic processes;Safety;Q-learning;Costs;Probabilistic logic;Predictive control;Reactive power;Reinforcement learning;Risk management;Safe reinforcement learning;model predictive control;distributionally robust optimization;chance constraint;conditional value at risk;Q-learning\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Origin\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 1,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"IEEE\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":16}],"source":["clean_ieee_df = ieee_df[[\"DOI\", \"Document Title\", \"Abstract\"]].copy()\n","clean_ieee_df.columns = [\"DOI\", \"Title\", \"Abstract\"]\n","clean_ieee_df[\"Keywords\"] = ieee_df[\"IEEE Terms\"].str.cat(ieee_df[\"Author Keywords\"], sep=\";\")\n","clean_ieee_df[\"ID\"] = ieee_df[\"PDF Link\"]\n","clean_ieee_df = clean_ieee_df.set_index(\"ID\")\n","clean_ieee_df[\"Origin\"] = \"IEEE\"\n","clean_ieee_df.index.name = \"ID\"\n","clean_ieee_df"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"p7EdZeE59ptJ"},"source":["## 1.4 Load results from Proquest\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"id":"lwrdd4Ab9tbC","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731071901275,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":3,"user":{"displayName":"Kristoffer Nicolay Broch Grude","userId":"17507872195165455814"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#setting the file path from proquest data\n","proQuest_file_path = \"drive/MyDrive/Master/Screening/Raw data/proquest.csv\""]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":18,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":424,"status":"ok","timestamp":1731071901696,"user":{"displayName":"Kristoffer Nicolay Broch Grude","userId":"17507872195165455814"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"-jQVA_lI9tbD","outputId":"cd548a2e-33de-4916-81ee-2ad236ea6db6"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                 Title  Subtitle  \\\n","0    Gaussian Process-Mixture Conditional Heterosce...

This paper introduces an alternative methodology to model-based simulation by using a Monte Carlo simulation of the Dirichlet process. The model is constructed in a Bayesian framework, using properties initially described by Ferguson. A notable advantage of this model is that, on average, the random draws are sampled from a mixed distribution that consists of a prior guess by an expert and the empirical process based on a random sample of historical asset returns. The method is relatively automatic and similar to machine learning tools, e.g. the estimate is updated as new data arrive. [PUBLICATION ABSTRACT]\",\n          \"In recent years machine learning algorithms have become a very popular tool for analysing financial data and forecasting stock prices. The goal of this article is to forecast five major stock market indexes (DAX, Dow Jones, NASDAQ, Nikkei 225 and S&P 500) using machine learning algorithms (Linear regression, Gaussian Processes, SMOreg and neural network Multilayer Perceptron) on historical data covering the period February 1, 2010, to January 31, 2020. The forecasts were made by using historical data in different base period lengths and forecasting horizons. The precision of machine learning algorithms was evaluated with the help of error metrics. The results of the analysis have shown that machine learning algorithms achieved highly accurate forecasting performance. The overall precision of all algorithms was better for shorter base period lengths and forecast horizons. The results obtained from this analysis could help investors in determining their optimal investment strategy. Stock price prediction remains, however, one of the most complex issues in the field of finance.\",\n          \"This study proposes a metaheuristic for the selection of models among different Expected Shortfall (ES) estimation methods. The proposed approach, denominated \\\"Commitment Machine\\\" (CM), has a strong focus on assets cross-correlation and allows to measure adaptively the ES, dynamically evaluating which is the most performing method through the minimization of a loss function. The CM algorithm compares four different ES estimation techniques which all take into account the interaction effects among assets: a Bayesian Vector autoregressive model, Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) numerical schemes with Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), a Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) volatility model and a hybrid method that integrates Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks together with a Monte Carlo approach. The integration of traditional Monte Carlo approaches with Machine Learning technologies and the heterogeneity of dynamically selected methodologies lead to an improved estimation of the ES. The study describes the techniques adopted by the CM and the logic behind model selection; moreover, it provides a market application case of the proposed metaheuristic, by simulating an equally weighted multi-asset portfolio.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Origin\",\n      \"properties\": {\n

Then, different machine learning algorithms (artificial neural network, k-nearest neighbors, random forest, gaussian processes, and support vector regression) were used to estimate MR, MC and drying rate. For MR estimation of Golden Delicious, Oregon Spur and Granny Smith cultivars, Random Forest was most successful algorithm with correlation coefficients (R) of 0.9800, 0.9873, and 0.9841, respectively. This was followed by SVR with R: 0.9323 for Golden Delicious, ANN with R: 0.9766 for Oregon Spur and 5-NN with R: 0.9827 for Granny Smith. MC and drying rate estimation results showed that RF, SVR, and k-NN achieved higher R for all cultivars. It was concluded that machine learning algorithms are an effective approach for the accurate estimation of the drying characteristics of apple slices. Practical applications: Machine learning-like precise modeling techniques are used to estimate the drying characteristics of agricultural commodities. Models should be assessed and compared for optimization of drying conditions and operational costs. Machine learning models predictions agreed well with testing data sets and they could be useful for understanding and controlling the factors affecting drying behaviors. \\u00a9 2022 Wiley Periodicals LLC.\",\n          \"Data-driven modeling and computational predictions based on the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt principle) aim to find as simple as possible\\u2014but not simpler than necessary\\u2014models that allow one to avoid the data-overfitting problem. We derive a multivariate nonparametric and nonstationary formulation of the MaxEnt principle and show that its solution can be approximated through a numerical maximization of the sparse constrained optimization problem with regularization. Application of the resulting algorithm to popular financial benchmarks reveals memoryless models allowing for simple and qualitative descriptions of data of the major stock market indices. We compare the obtained MaxEnt models to the heteroscedastic models from computational econometrics (GARCH, GARCH-GJR, MS-GARCH, and GARCH-PML4) in terms of the model fit, complexity, and prediction quality. We compare the resulting model log-likelihoods, the values of the Bayesian information criterion, posterior model probabilities, the quality of the data autocorrelation function fits, as well as the value-at-risk prediction quality. We show that all of the seven considered major financial benchmark time series (DJI, SPX, FTSE, STOXX, SMI, HSI, and N225) are better described by conditionally memoryless MaxEnt models with nonstationary regime-switching than by the common econometric models with finite memory. This analysis also reveals a sparse network of statistically significant temporal relations for the positive and negative latent variance changes among different markets.

In general, the analysis of its performance is usually undertaken by models of financial prediction or credit rating. This paper address a lot of models to analyze it through the financial ratio from 287 private enterprises of traditional industry public listed in Taiwan's stock market and OTC as sample data. A hybrid methodology that combines both data mining and artificial intelligence is proposed to take advantage of the unique strength of single one model. First, we use the data mining technique, such as traditional principal components analysis, to select network input variables. Second, the various different models, including the Probabilistic Neural Network are also considered. Third, this paper shows that the classification ability of the Probabilistic Neural Network model, after the parameter adjusted by genetic algorithm, does significantly outperform other simple methods-back-propagation network, decision tree, and logistic regression model. In conclusion, experimental results with real data sets indicate that combined model can be an effective way to improve forecasting classification accuracy achieved by either of the one single models.

This study proposes a deep learning based hybrid approach combining convolutional neural network (CNN), attention mechanism (AM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to predict short-term market trends (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 10 days) across different stock indices (BSE, HSI, IXIC, NIFTY, N225, SSE). The architecture dynamically weights the input sequence with the AM model, captures local patterns through CNN and effectively models long-term dependencies with GRU thus aiming to accurately classify either \\\"buy\\\" or \\\"sell\\\" positions of stocks. The model is assessed using classification and financial evaluation metrics involving accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, annualized returns, maximum drawdown, and return on investment. It outperforms benchmark models, and different technical indicators including average directional index, rate of change, moving average convergence divergence, and the buy-and-hold strategy, demonstrating its effectiveness in various market conditions. The proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 98% in predicting the 1 day-ahead direction, and an average accuracy of 88.53% across all prediction intervals. The model was also validated using the wilcoxon signed rank test that further supported its significance over the benchmark models. The CAG model presents a comprehensive and intuitive approach to stock market trend prediction, with potential applications in real-world asset decision-making.\",\n          \"The Black-Litterman portfolios based on the predictions provided by Gaussian Process are constructed in this study. Besides the expert views generated by the Gaussian Process, an customized algorithm quantifying the confidence level of the given investor opinions is also designed, which can be inputted into the Black-Litterman framework to revise the posterior parameters estimations. Low-risk anomaly is observed from the numerical experiments through the grouping method base on stock \\u03b2, demonstrating the potential irrationality for even giant companies and brands on the advanced market. Empirical analysis shows that Gaussian Process is able to model the low \\u03b2 stock effectively, while not feasible for stocks with high volatility. Thus, the proposed BLGPlo portfolio outperform the benchmarks in terms of cumulative excess return and Sharpe ratio. Moreover, the BLGPlo performance can be further improved by allocating higher confidence level for the Gaussian Process-derived investor opinions. \\u00a9 (2023), (International Association of Engineers).

However, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, forecasting stock indices accurately is challenging. In this paper, a deep nonlinear ensemble framework is proposed for stock index forecasting and uncertainty analysis. (1) Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is utilized to extract features from a raw stock index and eliminate the interference. (2) Enhanced weighted support vector machine (EWSVM) is proposed for forecasting each component that is decomposed, of which the penalty weights are based on the time order and the hyperparameters are optimized using the simulated annealing algorithm. (3) Recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to integrate the forecast of each component into the final point forecast. (4) Gaussian process regression (GPR) is applied to obtain the interval forecast of the original stock index. Two practical cases (Nikkei 225 Index, Japan and Hang Seng Index, Hong Kong, China) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. In terms of the results of point forecasting, the MAE, R-2, MAPE, and RMSE of Nikkei 225 Index are 66.0745, 0.9972, 0.0066, and 80.0381, and those of Hang Seng Index are 79.2145,0.9968, 0.0073, and 96.7740. In terms of the results of interval forecasting, the CP95% , MWP95% , and MC95% of Nikkei 225 Index are 0.89979, 0.05746, and 0.06385, and those of Hang Seng Index are 0.97985, 0.28223, and 0.28803. Forecasting stock indices accurately is crucial for investment decision and risk management and is extremely meaningful to investors and financial regulators. In this paper, the SSA-EWSVM-RNN-GPR model is used to forecast the closing prices of stock indices, and compared with eight benchmark models, the proposed SSA-EWSVM-RNN-GPR model can be an effective tool for both point and interval forecasting of stock indices.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n

The results show that the mixed copula model based on the HMM is more effective than the single copula model and the mixed copula model. The empirical structure shows that among the four major financial industries in China, banking and insurance industries have strong interdependence and a high probability of risk contagion. The investment failure rate under 95%, 97.5% and 99% confidence intervals calculated by the Copula-Garch model is 4.53%, 2.17% and 1.08%, respectively. Moreover, the errors of the deep learning Markov model in stock price prediction of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (sh600000), Guizhou Moutai (sh600519) and China Ping An Insurance (sh601318) are 2.56%, 2.98% and 3.56%, respectively, which indicates that the four major financial industries in China have strong interdependence and risk contagion so that the macro or systemic risks may arise, and the deep learning Markov model can be adopted to predict the stock prices.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 12,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1016/j.solener.2016.03.064\",\n          \"10.2140/camcos.2020.15.15\",\n          \"10.1016/j.eswa.2017.08.011\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 10,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"financial time series;

This approach has shown robustness through practice, but does not scale with increasing network size and generation of new transactions. Resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) networks are incompatible with full computation of schemes like Bitcoin's PoW. Our effort proposes a first step towards an alternative consensus using machine learning-based decision-making with prediction of fraud transactions to alleviate need for intense computation. To improve base approval probabilities for fraud detection in an ideal security setting, Vector GAN (VecGAN) is proposed to augment blockchain data in classifier training, which combines error-driven learning with Bayesian estimation to alleviate calculations. This two-step approach with augmentation and classification on new transactions is proposed as a novel approach to blockchain decision-making. Experimental prediction accuracy using VecGAN improved up to 3% on simplistic classifiers compared to other state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. Resource consumption in a realistic blockchain setting was reduced while improving block throughput by 50% compared to PoW. Future work will explore Sybil-spam defensive measures for realistic protocol implementation with this approach.  \\u00a9 2002-2012 IEEE.\",\n          \"Posts on social networks can both predict the movement of the financial market, and in some cases even determine its direction. The analysis of posts on Twitter contributes to the prediction of cryptocurrency prices. The specificity of the community is represented in a special vocabulary. Thus, slang expressions and abbreviations are used in posts, the presence of which makes it difficult to vectorize text data, as a result of which preprocessing methods such as Stanza lemmatization and the use of regular expressions are considered. This paper describes created simplest machine learning models, which may work despite such problems as lack of data and short prediction timeframe. A word is considered as an element of a binary vector of a data unit in the course of the problem of binary classification solving. Basic words are determined according to the frequency analysis of mentions of a word. The markup is based on Binance candlesticks with variable parameters for a more accurate description of the trend of price changes. The paper introduces metrics that reflect the distribution of words depending on their belonging to a positive or negative classes. To solve the classification problem, we used a dense model with parameters selected by Keras Tuner, logistic regression, a random forest classifier, a naive Bayesian classifier capable of working with a small sample, which is very important for our task, and the k-nearest neighbors method. The constructed models were compared based on the accuracy metric of the predicted labels. During the investigation we recognized that the best approach is to use models which predict price movements of a single coin. Our model deals with posts that mention LUNA project, which no longer exist. This approach to solving binary classification of text data is widely used to predict the price of an asset, the trend of its movement, which is often used in automated trading. \\u00a9 2023 Ivan S.

We survey the literature in order to discover whether the proposed methods provide superior forecasts compared to traditional econometric models, how widespread the application of explainable AI is, and to outline potential areas for further research. Generally, we find the efficacy of AI and ML methods for volatility prediction to be highly promising, often providing comparative or better results than their econometric counterparts. Neural networks employing memory, such as Long-Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, consistently rank among the top performing models. However, traditional econometric models are still highly relevant, commonly yielding similar results as more advanced ML and AI models. In light of the success with ensemble methods, a promising area of research is the use of hybrid models, combining machine learning and econometric models. In spite of the common critique of many machine learning models being of a black -box nature, we find that very few papers apply XAI to analyze and support their empirical results. Thus, we recommend that researchers strive harder to employ XAI in future work. Similarly, we see potential for applications of probabilistic machine learning, effectively quantifying uncertainty in volatility forecasts from machine learning models.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 303,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.1111/jfpp.16496\",\n          \"10.1111/jfpp.17011\",\n          \"10.3390/su14105826\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 283,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"Automobiles;Predictive models;Bayes methods;Artificial neural networks;Data models;Data mining;Mathematical models;Bayesian neural networks (NNs);latent factor;price prediction model;used car\",\n          \"Correlation;Data models;Predictive models;Time series analysis;Mathematical models;Deep learning;Forecasting;Convolutional neural networks;Stock markets;Financial industry;Time series analysis;Asset management;Financial services;Mean square error methods;Portfolios;Multiple factor;stock correlation prediction;time series prediction;attention mechanism;CNN;BiLSTM\",\n          \"Costs;Vehicle dynamics;Safety;Planning;Dynamics;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Roads;Integrated planning and learning;reinforcement learning;robot safety\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Origin\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"IEEE\",\n          \"SCOPUS\",\n          \"WOS\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"}},"metadata":{},"execution_count":24}],"source":["# Drop duplicates based on title\n","clean_df = clean_df.groupby(['Title'], as_index=False).first()\n","clean_df = clean_df.copy()\n","clean_df"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["# Set ID as index again\n","clean_df = clean_df.set_index(\"ID\")\n","clean_df"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":1000},"id":"xg39sqqZBZqL","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1731071902650,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":10,"user":{"displayName":"Kristoffer Nicolay Broch Grude","userId":"17507872195165455814"}},"outputId":"ae73d3b0-1b89-4a99-aad2-fa8ea645c9e4"},"execution_count":25,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["                                                                                                Title  \\\n","ID                                                                                                      \n","WOS:000779594700001                                 <i>DL-GuesS</i>: Deep Learning and Sentiment A...   \n","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arn...

This approach has shown robustness through practice, but does not scale with increasing network size and generation of new transactions. Resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) networks are incompatible with full computation of schemes like Bitcoin's PoW. Our effort proposes a first step towards an alternative consensus using machine learning-based decision-making with prediction of fraud transactions to alleviate need for intense computation. To improve base approval probabilities for fraud detection in an ideal security setting, Vector GAN (VecGAN) is proposed to augment blockchain data in classifier training, which combines error-driven learning with Bayesian estimation to alleviate calculations. This two-step approach with augmentation and classification on new transactions is proposed as a novel approach to blockchain decision-making. Experimental prediction accuracy using VecGAN improved up to 3% on simplistic classifiers compared to other state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. Resource consumption in a realistic blockchain setting was reduced while improving block throughput by 50% compared to PoW. Future work will explore Sybil-spam defensive measures for realistic protocol implementation with this approach.  \\u00a9 2002-2012 IEEE.\",\n          \"Posts on social networks can both predict the movement of the financial market, and in some cases even determine its direction. The analysis of posts on Twitter contributes to the prediction of cryptocurrency prices. The specificity of the community is represented in a special vocabulary. Thus, slang expressions and abbreviations are used in posts, the presence of which makes it difficult to vectorize text data, as a result of which preprocessing methods such as Stanza lemmatization and the use of regular expressions are considered. This paper describes created simplest machine learning models, which may work despite such problems as lack of data and short prediction timeframe. A word is considered as an element of a binary vector of a data unit in the course of the problem of binary classification solving. Basic words are determined according to the frequency analysis of mentions of a word. The markup is based on Binance candlesticks with variable parameters for a more accurate description of the trend of price changes. The paper introduces metrics that reflect the distribution of words depending on their belonging to a positive or negative classes. To solve the classification problem, we used a dense model with parameters selected by Keras Tuner, logistic regression, a random forest classifier, a naive Bayesian classifier capable of working with a small sample, which is very important for our task, and the k-nearest neighbors method. The constructed models were compared based on the accuracy metric of the predicted labels. During the investigation we recognized that the best approach is to use models which predict price movements of a single coin. Our model deals with posts that mention LUNA project, which no longer exist. This approach to solving binary classification of text data is widely used to predict the price of an asset, the trend of its movement, which is often used in automated trading. \\u00a9 2023 Ivan S.

Gorbachev.\",\n          \"In this systematic literature review, we examine the existing studies predicting realized volatility and implied volatility indices using artificial intelligence and machine learning. We survey the literature in order to discover whether the proposed methods provide superior forecasts compared to traditional econometric models, how widespread the application of explainable AI is, and to outline potential areas for further research. Generally, we find the efficacy of AI and ML methods for volatility prediction to be highly promising, often providing comparative or better results than their econometric counterparts. Neural networks employing memory, such as Long-Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, consistently rank among the top performing models. However, traditional econometric models are still highly relevant, commonly yielding similar results as more advanced ML and AI models. In light of the success with ensemble methods, a promising area of research is the use of hybrid models, combining machine learning and econometric models. In spite of the common critique of many machine learning models being of a black -box nature, we find that very few papers apply XAI to analyze and support their empirical results. Thus, we recommend that researchers strive harder to employ XAI in future work. Similarly, we see potential for applications of probabilistic machine learning, effectively quantifying uncertainty in volatility forecasts from machine learning models.\"\n        ],\n

This approach has shown robustness through practice, but does not scale with increasing network size and generation of new transactions. Resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) networks are incompatible with full computation of schemes like Bitcoin's PoW. Our effort proposes a first step towards an alternative consensus using machine learning-based decision-making with prediction of fraud transactions to alleviate need for intense computation. To improve base approval probabilities for fraud detection in an ideal security setting, Vector GAN (VecGAN) is proposed to augment blockchain data in classifier training, which combines error-driven learning with Bayesian estimation to alleviate calculations. This two-step approach with augmentation and classification on new transactions is proposed as a novel approach to blockchain decision-making. Experimental prediction accuracy using VecGAN improved up to 3% on simplistic classifiers compared to other state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. Resource consumption in a realistic blockchain setting was reduced while improving block throughput by 50% compared to PoW. Future work will explore Sybil-spam defensive measures for realistic protocol implementation with this approach.  \\u00a9 2002-2012 IEEE.\",\n          \"Posts on social networks can both predict the movement of the financial market, and in some cases even determine its direction. The analysis of posts on Twitter contributes to the prediction of cryptocurrency prices. The specificity of the community is represented in a special vocabulary. Thus, slang expressions and abbreviations are used in posts, the presence of which makes it difficult to vectorize text data, as a result of which preprocessing methods such as Stanza lemmatization and the use of regular expressions are considered. This paper describes created simplest machine learning models, which may work despite such problems as lack of data and short prediction timeframe. A word is considered as an element of a binary vector of a data unit in the course of the problem of binary classification solving. Basic words are determined according to the frequency analysis of mentions of a word. The markup is based on Binance candlesticks with variable parameters for a more accurate description of the trend of price changes. The paper introduces metrics that reflect the distribution of words depending on their belonging to a positive or negative classes. To solve the classification problem, we used a dense model with parameters selected by Keras Tuner, logistic regression, a random forest classifier, a naive Bayesian classifier capable of working with a small sample, which is very important for our task, and the k-nearest neighbors method. The constructed models were compared based on the accuracy metric of the predicted labels. During the investigation we recognized that the best approach is to use models which predict price movements of a single coin. Our model deals with posts that mention LUNA project, which no longer exist. This approach to solving binary classification of text data is widely used to predict the price of an asset, the trend of its movement, which is often used in automated trading. \\u00a9 2023 Ivan S.

Gorbachev.\",\n          \"In this systematic literature review, we examine the existing studies predicting realized volatility and implied volatility indices using artificial intelligence and machine learning. We survey the literature in order to discover whether the proposed methods provide superior forecasts compared to traditional econometric models, how widespread the application of explainable AI is, and to outline potential areas for further research. Generally, we find the efficacy of AI and ML methods for volatility prediction to be highly promising, often providing comparative or better results than their econometric counterparts. Neural networks employing memory, such as Long-Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, consistently rank among the top performing models. However, traditional econometric models are still highly relevant, commonly yielding similar results as more advanced ML and AI models. In light of the success with ensemble methods, a promising area of research is the use of hybrid models, combining machine learning and econometric models. In spite of the common critique of many machine learning models being of a black -box nature, we find that very few papers apply XAI to analyze and support their empirical results. Thus, we recommend that researchers strive harder to employ XAI in future work. Similarly, we see potential for applications of probabilistic machine learning, effectively quantifying uncertainty in volatility forecasts from machine learning models.\"\n        ],\n

However, when dealing with a large number of predictors, these methods may overfit the data and provide poor out-of-sample forecasts. Our paper addresses this issue by employing two different approaches to predict realized volatility. On the one hand, we use a two-step procedure where several dimensionality reduction methods, such as Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), are employed in the initial step to reduce dimensionality. The reduced samples are then combined with artificial neutral networks. On the other hand, we implement two single-step regularized neural networks that can shrink the input weights to zero and effectively handle high-dimensional data. Our findings on the volatility of different stock asset prices indicate that the reduced models outperform the compared models without regularization in terms of predictive accuracy.\",\n          \"The predispatch price forecast plays a key element in the electricity market. However, such a forecast usually depends on the traditional offline batch-learning technologies, which cannot respond in time to the unexpected changes in the local power system environment. Further, the predispatch local price forecast is often affected by the dynamic price changes from the neighboring regions. This article proposes a novel online learning forecast approach to overcome the above issues to provide a better predispatch price forecast by using the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) algorithm. The article proposes a novel data structure in the form of a 2-D orthogonal list and two corresponding OS-ELM modules. One module provides the rolling day-ahead price prediction and prediction intervals using the day-by-day online training update, while the other provides the rolling 30-min prediction using the 2-h-by-2-h online training update. The proposed approach can continuously perceive any unexpected events and any price fluctuations from the neighboring regions in the nonlinear patterns. The proposed approach is validated using simulation studies based on the data from the Australian electricity market, and the simulation results show that the proposed approach can help in improving the forecast accuracy, especially when unexpected changes occur both locally and in the neighboring area.\",\n          \"Data-driven modeling and computational predictions based on the maximum entropy principle (MaxEnt principle) aim to find as simple as possible-but not simpler than necessary-models that allow one to avoid the data-overfitting problem. We derive a multivariate nonparametric and nonstationary formulation of the MaxEnt principle and show that its solution can be approximated through a numerical maximization of the sparse constrained optimization problem with regularization. Application of the resulting algorithm to popular financial benchmarks reveals memoryless models allowing for simple and qualitative descriptions of data of the major stock market indices. We compare the obtained MaxEnt models to the heteroscedastic models from computational econometrics (GARCH, GARCH-GJR, MS-GARCH, and GARCH-PML4) in terms of the model fit, complexity, and prediction quality. We compare the resulting model log-likelihoods, the values of the Bayesian information criterion, posterior model probabilities, the quality of the data autocorrelation function fits, as well as the value-at-risk prediction quality. We show that all of the seven considered major financial benchmark time series (DJI, SPX, FTSE, STOXX, SMI, HSI, and N225) are better described by conditionally memoryless MaxEnt models with nonstationary regime-switching than by the common econometric models with finite memory. This analysis also reveals a sparse network of statistically significant temporal relations for the positive and negative latent variance changes among different markets.

The Mauritian forex market has been utilized as a case study, and daily data for nominal spot rate (during a time period of five years spanning from 2014 to 2018) for EUR/MUR, GBP/MUR, CAD/MUR and AUD/MUR have been applied for the predictions. Design/methodology/approach Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models are used as a basis for time series modelling for the analysis, along with the non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) neural network backpropagation algorithm utilizing different training functions, namely, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian regularization and scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) algorithms. The study also features a hybrid kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm as an additional statistical tool to conduct financial market forecasting modelling. Mean squared error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are employed as indicators for the performance of the models. Findings The results demonstrated that the GARCH model performed better in terms of volatility clustering and prediction compared to the ARIMA model. On the other hand, the NARX model indicated that LM and Bayesian regularization training algorithms are the most appropriate method of forecasting the different currency exchange rates as the MSE and RMSE seemed to be the lowest error compared to the other training functions. Meanwhile, the results reported that NARX and KPCA-SVR topologies outperformed the linear time series models due to the theory based on the structural risk minimization principle. Finally, the comparison between the NARX model and KPCA-SVR illustrated that the NARX model outperformed the statistical prediction model. Overall, the study deduced that the NARX topology achieves better prediction performance results compared to time series and statistical parameters. Research limitations/implications The foreign exchange market is considered to be instable owing to uncertainties in the economic environment of any country and thus, accurate forecasting of foreign exchange rates is crucial for any foreign exchange activity. The study has an important economic implication as it will help researchers, investors, traders, speculators and financial analysts, users of financial news in banking and financial institutions, money changers, non-banking financial companies and stock exchange institutions in Mauritius to take investment decisions in terms of international portfolios. Moreover, currency rates instability might raise transaction costs and diminish the returns in terms of international trade. Exchange rate volatility raises the need to implement a highly organized risk management measures so as to disclose future trend and movement of the foreign currencies which could act as an essential guidance for foreign exchange participants. By this way, they will be more alert before conducting any forex transactions including hedging, asset pricing or any speculation activity, take corrective actions, thus preventing them from making any potential losses in the future and gain more profit. Originality/value This is one of the first studies applying artificial intelligence (AI) while making use of time series modelling, the NARX neural network backpropagation algorithm and hybrid KPCA-SVR to predict forex using multiple currencies in the foreign exchange market in Mauritius.\",\n          \"In empirical modeling, there have been two strands for pricing in the options literature, namely the parametric and nonparametric models. Often, the support for the nonparametric methods is based on a benchmark such as the Black-Scholes (BS) model with constant volatility. In this paper, we study the stochastic volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility random jump (SVJ) models as parametric benchmarks against feedforward neural network (FNN) models, a class of neural network models. Our choice for FNN models is due to their well-studied universal approximation properties of an unknown function and its partial derivatives. Since the partial derivatives of an option pricing formula are risk pricing tools, an accurate estimation of the unknown option pricing function is essential for pricing and hedging. Our findings indicate that FNN models offer themselves as robust option pricing tools, over their sophisticated parametric counterparts in predictive settings. There are two routes to explain the superiority of FNN models over the parametric models in forecast settings. These are nonnormality of return distributions and adaptive learning\",\n          \"Due to the remarkable boost in cryptocurrency trading on digital blockchain platforms, the utilization of advanced machine learning systems for robust prediction of highly nonlinear and noisy data, gains further popularity by individual and institutional market agents. The purpose of our study is to comparatively evaluate a plethora of Artificial Intelligence systems in forecasting high frequency Bitcoin price series. We employ three different sets of models, i.e., statistical machine learning approaches including support vector regressions (SVR) and Gaussian Poisson regressions (GRP), algorithmic models such as regression trees (RT) and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and finally artificial neural network topologies such as feedforward (FFNN), Bayesian regularization (BRNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an extensive empirical investigation of the comparative predictability of various machine learning models is implemented in high-frequency trading of Bitcoin. The entropy analysis of training and testing samples reveals long memory traits, high levels of stochasticity, and topological complexity. The presence of inherent nonlinear dynamics of Bitcoin time series fully rationalizes the use of advanced machines learning techniques. The optimal parameter values for SVR, GRP and kNN are found via Bayesian optimization. Based on diverse performance metrics, our results show that the BRNN renders an outstanding accuracy in forecasting, while its convergence is unhindered and remarkably fast. The overall superiority of artificial neural networks is due to parallel processing features that efficiently emulate human decision-making in the presence of underlying nonlinear input-output relationships in noisy signal environments.

This holds immense value for investors, as it empowers them to make data-driven decisions. Identifying current and future trends in multi-class forecasting techniques employed within financial markets, particularly profitability analysis as an evaluation metric is important. The review focuses on examining stud-ies conducted between 2018 and 2023, sourced from three prominent academic databases. A meticulous three-stage approach was employed, encompassing the systematic planning, conduct, and analysis of the se-lected studies. Specifically, the analysis emphasizes technical assessment, profitability analysis, hybrid mod-eling, and the type of results generated by models. Articles were shortlisted based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, while a rigorous quality assessment through ten quality criteria questions, utilizing a Likert-type scale was employed to ensure methodological robustness. We observed that ensemble and hybrid models with long short-term memory (LSTM) and support vector machines (SVM) are being more adopted for financial trends and price prediction. Moreover, hybrid models employing AI algorithms for feature engineering have great potential at par with ensemble techniques. Most studies only employ performance metrics and lack utilization of profitability metrics or investment or trading strategy (simulated or real-time). Similarly, research on multi-class or output is severely lacking in financial forecasting and can be a good avenue for future research.\",\n          \"In this systematic literature review, we examine the existing studies predicting realized volatility and implied volatility indices using artificial intelligence and machine learning. We survey the literature in order to discover whether the proposed methods provide superior forecasts compared to traditional econometric models, how widespread the application of explainable AI is, and to outline potential areas for further research. Generally, we find the efficacy of AI and ML methods for volatility prediction to be highly promising, often providing comparative or better results than their econometric counterparts. Neural networks employing memory, such as Long-Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, consistently rank among the top performing models. However, traditional econometric models are still highly relevant, commonly yielding similar results as more advanced ML and AI models. In light of the success with ensemble methods, a promising area of research is the use of hybrid models, combining machine learning and econometric models. In spite of the common critique of many machine learning models being of a black -box nature, we find that very few papers apply XAI to analyze and support their empirical results. Thus, we recommend that researchers strive harder to employ XAI in future work. Similarly, we see potential for applications of probabilistic machine learning, effectively quantifying uncertainty in volatility forecasts from machine learning models.\",\n          \"Financial time-series are well known for their non-linearity and non-stationarity nature. The application of conventional econometric models in prediction can incur significant errors. The fast advancement of soft computing techniques provides an alternative approach for estimating and forecasting volatile stock prices. Soft computing approaches exploit tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth to progressively and adaptively solve practical problems. In this study, a comprehensive review of latest soft computing tools is given. Then, examples incorporating a series of machine learning models, including both single and hybrid models, to predict prices of two representative indexes and one stock in Hong Kong's market are undertaken. The prediction performances of different models are evaluated and compared. The effects of the training sample size and stock patterns (viz. momentum and mean reversion) on model prediction are also investigated. Results indicate that artificial neural network (ANN)-based models yield the highest prediction accuracy. It was also found that the determination of optimal training sample size should take the pattern and volatility of stocks into consideration. Large prediction errors could be incurred when stocks exhibit a transition between mean reversion and momentum trend.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"DOI\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"10.3390/axioms8040116\",\n          \"10.1109/access.2023.3330156\",\n          \"10.1016/j.irfa.2024.103221\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"Keywords\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"string\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 7,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"machine learning;

Recently, machine learning models have elicited considerable attention from researchers because of their improved prediction accuracy in pricing financial derivatives. We propose a generative Bayesian learning model that incorporates a prior reflecting a risk-neutral pricing structure to provide fair prices for the deep ITM and the deep OTM options that are rarely traded. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study to compare classical financial option models with machine learning models in terms of model estimation and prediction using S&P 100 American put options from 2003 to 2012. Results indicate that machine learning models demonstrate better prediction performance than the classical financial option models. Especially, we observe that the generative Bayesian neural network model demonstrates the best overall prediction performance.\",\n          \"Portfolio selection aims to manage the allocation of wealth among different assets, which remains to be a fundamental and challenging financial task. Markowitz's mean-variance analysis is one of the most well-known and widely adopted techniques for this problem. However, it requires accurate estimations of both the mean and variance of the return, while predicting the variance is particularly difficult. In this article, we propose a novel portfolio selection strategy based on a graph-aware Gaussian process model equipped with generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) likelihood. Our method unleashes the potential of mean-variance analysis by exploiting the Gaussian process model's ability in capturing uncertainty, and the graph information is also incorporated so that correlation among different assets can be utilized. We notice that most existing financial models assume the returns follow the log-normal distribution, whereas we observe that it cannot perfectly explain real-world market data. Based on this discovery, we introduce the GGD as the likelihood function. We further improve our method by proposing a passive variant to address transaction fees, and designing the mean function of the Gaussian process with the mean reversion principle. Thorough experiments were performed on synthetic and real-world financial datasets to verify the effectiveness of our method.\",\n          \"In competitive electricity markets, prices are determined by the collective behaviour of suppliers and consumers. Hence, these systems rely on the balance between supply and demand, and sudden changes in the underlying conditions can lead to significant price fluctuations. In the face of the recent transformations in Italian electricity markets, which are driven by an increasing share of non-programmable renewables, energy crises, and geopolitical tensions, our study focuses on effective forecasting methodologies. We compare kernel and linear regression for predicting market equilibrium prices, both in point and probabilistic sense. We showcase the potential of both linear and non-linear models when carefully engineering the problem of interest, which involves properly selecting data and variables. The noteworthy outcome is that, while linear and non-linear models may differ in nature, their performance converges closely, attesting to the robustness of our approach in achieving reliable forecasts. We describe data sources and assumptions in exploratory univariate analyses, and the performance of the final multivariate model is evaluated over a test period on September 2023.\"\n        ],\n

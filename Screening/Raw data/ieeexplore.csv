However, due to the high volatility and non-stationary nature of the stock market, forecasting the trend of a financial time series remains a big challenge. In this paper, we introduced a new method to simplify noisy-filled financial temporal series via sequence reconstruction by leveraging motifs (frequent patterns), and then utilize a convolutional neural network to capture spatial structure of time series.

Accurate stock price forecasting not only aids the government in predicting economic trends but also helps investors anticipate higher expected returns. Nevertheless, hurdles such as nonlinearity, complexity and high volatility make it a daunting task to predict stock prices. To address this issue, this study proposes a new hybrid model, termed Hierarchical Decomposition-based Forecasting Model (HDFM), to decompose and forecast stock prices in a hierarchical fashion. The model utilizes complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) for the initial decomposition of stock price time series. To enhance the predictive efficiency, sub-series with similar sample entropy from the decomposition were combined using the K-means clustering method. Through a thorough analysis, it was found that the first combined sub-series contained more high-frequency signals. Therefore, the first combined sub-series is subjected to a second decomposition with variational mode decomposition (VMD). Subsequently, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model was used to individually predict each sub-series. The final results were obtained by merging the prediction outcomes. The proposed model was evaluated on three different stock markets. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other forecasting methods across all stock indices. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of each component within the proposed model.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3384430","Shandong Provincial Natural Science Foundation(grant numbers:ZR2021MF085,ZR2021MC044,ZR2022ME155,ZR2023QC116); Shandong Provincial Key Research Project on Financial Applications(grant numbers:2021-JRZZ-27); Doctoral Research Foundation of Weifang University(grant numbers:2022BS48); Doctoral Research Foundation of Weifang University of Science and Technology(grant numbers:2021RWBS10); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10488422","Stock price prediction;deep learning;hierarchical decomposition;clustering","Predictive models;Hidden Markov models;Forecasting;Autoregressive processes;Deep learning;Time series analysis;Adaptation models;Stock markets;Hierarchical systems;Clustering algorithms","","2","","42","CCBY","3 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"
"Ensemble Technique With Optimal Feature Selection for Saudi Stock Market Prediction: A Novel Hybrid Red Deer-Grey Algorithm","S. S.

The exact estimation of the movement of share price would contribute more to investors' profit. This paper introduces a new stock market prediction model that includes three major phases: feature extraction, optimal feature selection, and prediction. Initially, statistical features like mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis is extracted from the collected stock market data. Further, the indexed data collected are also computed concerning standard indicators like Average True Range (ATR), Exponential Moving Average (EMA), Relative Strength Index (RSI), and Rate of Change (ROC). To acquire best-predicted results, it is more crucial to select the most relevant features. Such that, the optimal features are selected from the extracted features (technical indicators based features, statistical features) by a new hybrid model referred to Red Deer Adopted Wolf Algorithm (RDAWA). Further, the selected features are subjected to the ensemble technique for predicting the stock movement. The ensemble technique involves the classifiers like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Random Forest1 (RF1), Random Forest2 (RF2), and optimized Neural Network (NN), respectively. The final predicted results are acquired from the Optimized Neural Network (NN). To make the precise prediction, the training of NN is carried out by the proposed RDAWA via fine-tuning the optimal weight. Finally, the performance of the proposed work is compared over other conventional models with respect to certain measures.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3073507","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9405660","Saudi stock market prediction;close price;second order technical indicators;pre classifier","Hidden Markov models;Forecasting;Stock markets;Feature extraction;Support vector machines;Predictive models;Indexes","","28","","39","CCBY","15 Apr 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this study, an empirical evaluation of eight conventional machine learning models’ is conducted to forecast the stock price of eleven companies belonging to the Saudi Stock Exchange. Moreover, the optimal configuration of hyperparameters in each machine learning model is identified. Forecasting performance is evaluated by two well-known error metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Wilcoxson effect size is utilized to determine the impact of hyperparameter tuning by comparing tuned and un-tuned machine learning models’ forecasting performance. Empirical results indicate there are varying impacts of hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models in forecasting stock price. After tuning the hyperparameters, Support Vector Regression outperforms other forecasting models with a significant statistical difference. In contrast, Kernel Ridge Regression shows noteworthy forecasting performance without hyperparameter tuning with respect to other un-tuned forecasting models.

It causes massive losses and undermines investors' confidence and the integrity of the stock market. Several existing research works focused on detecting a specific manipulation scheme using supervised learning but lacks the adaptive capability to capture different manipulative strategies. This begets the assumption of model parameter values specific to the underlying manipulation scheme. In addition, supervised learning requires the use of labelled data which is difficult to acquire due to confidentiality and the proprietary nature of trading data. The proposed research establishes a detection model based on unsupervised learning using Kernel Principal Component Analysis (KPCA) and applied increased variance of selected latent features in higher dimensions. A proposed Multidimensional Kernel Density Estimation (MKDE) clustering is then applied upon the selected components to identify abnormal patterns of manipulation in data. This research has an advantage over the existing methods in overcoming the ambiguity of assuming values of several parameters, reducing the high dimensions obtained from conventional KPCA and thereby reducing computational complexity. The robustness of the detection model has also been evaluated when two or more manipulative activities occur within a short duration of each other and by varying the window length of the dataset fed to the model. Validation on multiple datasets and a comprehensive assessment of the model performance has been conducted without providing any prior information about the location of the manipulation. The results show a significant performance enhancement in terms of the F-measure values and a significant reduction in false alarm rate (FAR) has been achieved.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3011590","Research and Development Fund, Department of Computer and Information Sciences, Northumbria University, Newcastle upon Tyne, U.K; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9146609","Market abuse;stock price manipulation;anomaly detection;kernel principal component analyses;multi-dimensional kernel density estimate clustering","Stock markets;Kernel;Manipulators;Data models;Principal component analysis;Feature extraction;Computational modeling","","14","","67","CCBY","23 Jul 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Especially with the globalization of the world economy and integration of international financial markets, the complex relationships between markets from different countries should be considered in forecasting market trends, involving multi-layered, interactive, evolutionary, and heterogeneous financial variables and the couplings between variable sets from different countries. A variety of methods have been proposed and implemented for forecasting stock market trends, but there is very limited work reported on predicting a market's movement based on analyzing the multi-layered, hidden coupling relationships between various markets in different countries. This involves the analysis of hierarchical coupled behaviors and their relationships across multiple markets, and the nonlinear market dynamics. To address this critical issue, this paper proposes a new approach Multi-layer Coupled Hidden Markov Model (MCHMM) for Hierarchical Cross-market Behavior Analysis (HCBA), namely exploring the complex coupling relationships between variables of markets from a country (Layer-1 coupling) and couplings between markets from various countries (Layer-2 coupling), to forecast a stock market's movements. Toward capturing the hierarchical coupled market behaviors, a Multi-layered Coupled Hidden Markov Model (MCHMM) is built to infer movements of a stock market in a target country by forecasting its price return probabilities. The experimental results on 11 years of data from two types of markets (stock market and currency market) of 13 countries show that our proposed approach outperforms other four benchmarks from technical and business perspectives.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2019.2950437","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71801072,71774047); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8887150","Cross-market behavior analysis;MCHMM;trend forecasting;financial market","Hidden Markov models;Couplings;Forecasting;Market research;Stock markets;Time series analysis;Currencies","","11","","33","CCBY","30 Oct 2019","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Existing time-series models have limited prediction accuracy when faced with the characteristics of nonlinearity and nonstationarity in complex situations related to energy and finance. To enhance overall prediction capabilities and improve forecasting accuracy, in this article we propose a fuzzy interval time-series forecasting model on the basis of network-based multiple time-frequency spaces and the induced-ordered weighted averaging aggregation (IOWA) operation. Specifically, a time-series signal is decomposed into ensemble empirical modes and then reconstructed as various time-frequency spaces, which are transformed into visibility graphs. Then, forecasting intervals in different spaces can be collected after the local random walker link prediction model is adopted. Furthermore, a rule-based representation value function inspired by Yager's golden rule approach is defined, and an appropriate representation value is calculated. Finally, after IOWA is used to aggregate the forecasting outcomes in different time-frequency spaces, the final forecast value can be obtained from the fuzzy forecasting interval. Considering that energy issues are of widespread interest in nature and the social economy, two cases, based on a hydrological time series from the Biliuhe River in China and two well-known sets of financial time-series data, Taiwan Stock Exchange Capitalization Weighted Stock Index and Hang Seng Index, are studied to test the performance of the proposed approach in comparison with existing models.

Recent studies have shown that news articles and social media analysis can have an immense impact on investors’ opinion toward financial markets. Thus, the purpose of this study is to explore the relationship between news sentiment and stock market movement using information from different news agencies, business magazines, and financial portals. This study offers an application of the Bayesian structural time (BST) series model that is more transparent and facilitates better handling of uncertainty than the autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) model and the vector autoregression (VAR) method by using prior information about the structure of the model. One of the main pitfalls of this model is the presumption of linearity. The long short-term memory (LSTM) model is a nonlinear model that can capture various nonlinear structures present in the data set. We propose a hybrid model, which combines the LSTM model with the BST model along with the regression component that captures information from different news sources to identify market predictors. The proposed model detects unusual behavior or anomalous pattern of the stock price movement, which makes our model superior compared to the traditional methods.

In order to provide a safe policy by construction, we first propose using parameterized nonlinear DRMPC at each time step. DRMPC optimizes a finite-horizon cost function subject to the worst-case constraint violation in an ambiguity set. We use a statistical ball around the empirical distribution with a radius measured by the Wasserstein metric as the ambiguity set. Unlike the sample average approximation SMPC, DRMPC provides a probabilistic guarantee of the out-of-sample risk and requires lower samples from the disturbance. Then the Q-learning method is used to optimize the parameters in the DRMPC to achieve the best closed-loop performance.

Recently, the hybrid models integrating artificial neural networks with GARCH-type models have been developed, and performance gains from the models have been found to be outstanding. However, there have been few studies of hybrid models considering the nature of the distribution of financial data. Distribution of volatility time-series is highly concentrated near zero, and such aspect can cause low prediction performance on the whole domain of probability density function because weights in the networks can be trained to obtain accurate prediction only for the high frequency region, that is, near zero. To overcome the challenge, we propose a new hybrid model with GARCH-type models based on a novel non-linear filtering method to mitigate concentration property of volatility. For the filtering, we utilize root-type functions that transform extremely left-biased and pointed distribution of original volatility to a volume-upped (VU) distribution shifted to the right. Long short-term memory (LSTM) is employed as the basic implementation model, and the realized volatility of S&P 500 is predicted using the proposed models. It is found that the proposed hybrid model (VU-GARCH-LSTM) obtains 21.03% performance gain with respect to the root mean square error (RMSE) against the mean performances of the existing hybrid models integrating LSTM with GARCH-type models.

In such cases, better prediction is often achieved by combining forecasts from multiple models rather than using a single model in isolation. This combination of forecasts from the base learners is known as decision fusion. Furthermore, although decision fusion is typical and essential for making the best possible use of multiple forecasts, few studies have systematically summarized the studies that apply this technique. Therefore, there is an urgent need for a literature review reflecting the application of decision fusion in this field. To this end, this study systematically reviewed research related to decision fusion for stock market prediction, focusing on the characteristics of base learners and decision fusion methods. Specifically, the research trend on this topic, which has shifted over the past two decades, is discussed.

However, these studies only verify the linkage relationship of two or more time series by empirical tests without providing any theoretical explanation. This makes it difficult to choose a linkage time series without using many tests. In this paper, a novel two-factor fuzzy-fluctuation time series (FFTS) forecasting model is proposed based on the probabilistic linguistic preference relationship (PLPR) and similarity measure. It not only proposes the idea of combining external factors with internal potential trends but also explains the linkage mechanism of time series fluctuations from the perspective of behavioral preference. Specifically, the probabilistic linguistic preference logical relationship (PLPLR) is employed to express the fluctuation behavior rule and preference attribute from the history testing dataset. The Euclidean distance or Hamming distance between the “current state” and the left side of training PLPLRs is introduced as a similarity comparison method for the identification of appropriate rules.

To predict the stock prices of three distinct companies General Electric (GE), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) datasets. This study presents a novel hybrid model that combines the Double Exponential Smoothing (DES) method with a Deep Learning (DL) model Dual Attention Encoder-Decoder based Bi-directional GRU, optimized using Bayesian Optimization (DES-DA-ED-Bi-GRU-BO). By combining the best features of contemporary and old methods, the hybrid model seeks to efficiently identify patterns and trends in stock data. When handling time series data, the DES method offers a reliable and flexible mechanism that considers trends and seasonality in the data. The DA-ED-Bi-GRU added to the deep learning model further improves its comprehension of intricate patterns found in the stock data. The parameters are adjusted using Bayesian optimization (BO) to maximize the model’s performance. Several performance indicators, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-Square ( $R^{2}$ ), and Theil’s U-Statistics (TUS), are used to assess the effectiveness of the model. These measures offer thorough insights into the precision, dependability, and accuracy of the model’s predictions. The experimental findings show that the proposed hybrid model has the ability to predict GE, MSFT, and AMZN stock values with reasonable accuracy. Along with the optimization framework, DL and conventional smoothing approaches combine to provide a potent forecasting tool that may help traders and investors make wise judgments.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3435683","VIT-AP University; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10614598","Double exponential smoothing (DES);dual attention mechanism (DA);encoder-decoder (ED);bi-directional GRU (Bi-GRU);Bayesian optimization (BO);stock price prediction","Predictive models;Accuracy;Forecasting;Smoothing methods;Data models;Time series analysis;Measurement;Encoders;Stock markets;Pricing","","","","52","CCBY","30 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In the econometric domain, where exogenous factors play a crucial role; there is a pressing need for more studies focusing on multivariate forecasting. This paper introduces a novel hybrid model, HyBiLSTM. It integrates an ARIMAX GARCHX model for initial forecasting, followed by a second forecasting phase that addresses the residuals using a bidirectional long short-term memory model optimized through grey wolf optimization algorithm. The final forecast is a composite derived from both models. Three quantitative metrics (mean absolute error, root mean square error, and mean absolute percentage error) assessed the model performance using data that spanned social and economic variables from July 1, 2019, to December 31, 2022. The results revealed several key findings: 1) The addition of exogenous factors improved the performance of the ARIMA and GARCH models. 2) The BiLSTM variant outperformed other LSTM variants when combined with the ARIMAX GARCHX model. 3) An analysis using Shapley additive explanations indicated that bitcoin price was influenced by stock prices, Twitter volume, gold prices, and the Twitter sentiment index. 4) The presence of a structural break had a significant effect on the model’s forecasting accuracy. Beyond expanding the academic literature on hybrid models within a multivariate context, this offers valuable practical insights for investors. Specifically, it analyzes various factors that could serve as early indicators of bitcoin price fluctuations.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3386029","Digital Science for Economy, Society, Human Resources Innovative Development and Environment; Reinventing Universities & Research Institutes(grant numbers:2046735); Ministry of Higher Education, Science, Research and Innovation, Thailand; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10494511","LSTM;ARIMAX;GARCHX;bitcoin;SHAP;bidirectional LSTM","Biological system modeling;Predictive models;Long short term memory;Forecasting;Bitcoin;Data models;Time series analysis","","","","47","CCBYNCND","8 Apr 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation.

Sullivan and Woodall proposed a Markov-based formulation and a forecasting model to reduce computational overhead; however, its applicability is limited to handling one-factor problems. In this paper, we propose a novel forecasting model based on the hidden Markov model by enhancing Sullivan and Woodall's work to allow handling of two-factor forecasting problems.

To test the effectiveness of the resulting stochastic model, we conduct two experiments and compare the results with those from other models. The first experiment consists of forecasting the daily average temperature and cloud density in Taipei, Taiwan, and the second experiment is based on the Taiwan Weighted Stock Index by forecasting the exchange rate of the New Taiwan dollar against the U.S. dollar.

These stem from the integration of wind and solar energy sources with inherently stochastic generation behavior. The ensuing risks include power plant curtailments or grid imbalances. The deterministic approaches that currently underpin most planning have proven insufficient to manage these risks. This paper presents an alternative in the form of a data-driven probabilistic approach with direct relevance for transmission system operators. The models present a novel methodology that is independent of the common boundary conditions, e.g. case-specific models. First, we compare several data-driven algorithms and assign the forecasting task to the best-performing one. Second, the resulting forecast serves as an input for three optimal power flow (OPF) problems we tailor to the German power system. These problems minimize energy import volumes, energy import costs, and overall power losses. Third, based on the OPF results, we perform a risk assessment for operational instability, power loss, financial losses, and renewable energy waste. The results show that neural networks slightly outperform traditional machine learning algorithms in forecasting accuracy. However, linear-quadratic regulators remain attractive for their simplicity-performance ratio. Our probabilistic OPF approach can reduce power losses and identify frequency and line loading irregularities that deterministic methods do not. The data-driven approach we propose is superior to existing approaches in terms of its performance, usability, and applicability to complex power systems.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3463882","Open Access Publication Fund of the Technische Universitat Berlin; DeRive project; German Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Climate Action (BMWK)(grant numbers:01MV22014F); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10684197","Machine learning;power systems reliability;power forecasting;uncertain optimization;risk assessment","Uncertainty;Probabilistic logic;Costs;Wind energy;Forecasting;Wind power generation;Power system stability;Machine learning;Power system reliability;Risk management","","","","41","CCBYNCND","19 Sep 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

To solve the formulated risk-aware physical distancing problem, we propose two stages solution approach by imposing control flow, linear model, and curve-fitting schemes. Notably, in the first stage, we determine a PAN creator’s safe movement distance by proposing a probabilistic linear model. This scheme can effectively cope with a tail-risk from the probability distribution by satisfying the CVaR constraint for estimating safe movement distance. In the second stage, we design a Levenberg-Marquardt (LM)-based curve fitting algorithm upon the recommended safety distance and current distances between the PAN creator and others to find an optimal high-risk trajectory plan for the PAN creator. Finally, we have performed an extensive performance analysis using state-of-the-art Bluetooth data to establish the proposed risk-aware physical distancing system’s effectiveness. Our experimental results show that the proposed solution approach can effectively reduce the risk of recommending safety distance towards ensuring private safety.

In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on methodologies widely used in the field of statistical machine learning. Specifically, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian mixture of Gaussian process regression models, each component of which models the noise variance process that contaminates the observed data as a separate latent Gaussian process driven by the observed data. This way, we essentially obtain a Gaussian process-mixture conditional heteroscedasticity (GPMCH) model for volatility modeling in financial return series.

The objective is to improve the accuracy of short-term equity correlation forecasts, which is essential for the efficient management of financial asset portfolios. The existing time series models usually only take into account the effect of stock historical data characteristics on stock correlation but ignore the fact that stock correlation is affected by multiple factors and undergoes an unknown unstable trend. More efficient methods or algorithms need to be devised to deal with financial data. This paper explores stock metrics and introduces a multi-factor model to quantify the factors affecting stock returns in order to calculate the correlation between stocks. Meanwhile, to cope with the problem of incomplete input data, this paper simultaneously incorporates stock return data that is directly related to the correlation data. In the CNN-BiLSTM-Attention (CLATT) model, the role of the CNN module is to obtain high-dimensional features from the input time series data, and the role of the BiLSTM module is to process the time series information to capture the time-series features in the stock return data and correlation data in the sample. In order to acquire the inherent correlation between the input stock return data and correlation data and to enhance the prediction accuracy of the model, the attention mechanism is finally implemented and used to optimize the weights of the BiLSTM output. In this paper, mean square error (MSE), root mean square error (RMSE), mean absolute error (MAE) metrics, mean absolute percentage of error (MAPE), and the coefficient of determination  $R^{2}$ , as well as four benchmark models, are used to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. The result shows that the CLATT model has 57.32% and 33% improvement in the correlation prediction accuracy of different stock portfolios compared to the single LSTM model, and the model prediction accuracy has been improved. Compared with the benchmark CNN-BiLSTM, it also has 56.06% and 28.87% improvement.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2024.3369419","Scientific Research Project of Higher Education Institutions in Anhui Province(grant numbers:2022AH040361); Collaborative Innovation Project of Anhui Universities(grant numbers:GXXT-2022-082); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10444524","Multiple factor;stock correlation prediction;time series prediction;attention mechanism;CNN;BiLSTM","Correlation;Data models;Predictive models;Time series analysis;Mathematical models;Deep learning;Forecasting;Convolutional neural networks;Stock markets;Financial industry;Time series analysis;Asset management;Financial services;Mean square error methods;Portfolios","","1","","39","CCBYNCND","23 Feb 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

The proposed framework demonstrates the use of sophisticated machine learning models in predicting the short and medium-term trends and actual values of Bitcoin prices. This research goes beyond previous work that has only looked at machine learning-based categorization for a single day by instead using such models to forecast price changes seven, thirty, and ninety days into the future. The generated models are useful and work admirably, with the classification models reaching a maximum accuracy enhancement up to 31.48% for a 90-day prediction and a 11.76% F1-score for a forecast extending to the thirtieth day.

Instead of manually designing costs based on terrain features, existing methods learn terrain properties directly from data via self-supervision to automatically penalize trajectories moving through undesirable terrain, but challenges remain in properly quantifying and mitigating the risk due to uncertainty in the learned models. To this end, we present evidential off-road autonomy (EVORA), a unified framework to learn uncertainty-aware traction model and plan risk-aware trajectories. For uncertainty quantification, we efficiently model both aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty by learning discrete traction distributions and probability densities of the traction predictor's latent features. Leveraging evidential deep learning, we parameterize Dirichlet distributions with the network outputs and propose a novel uncertainty-aware squared Earth Mover's Distance loss with a closed-form expression that improves learning accuracy and navigation performance. For risk-aware navigation, the proposed planner simulates state trajectories with the worst-case expected traction to handle aleatoric uncertainty and penalizes trajectories moving through terrain with high epistemic uncertainty. Our approach is extensively validated in simulation and on wheeled and quadruped robots, showing improved navigation performance compared to methods that assume no slip, assume the expected traction, or optimize for the worst-case expected cost.","1941-0468","","10.1109/TRO.2024.3431828","ARL(grant numbers:W911NF-21-2-0150); ONR(grant numbers:N00014-18-1-2832); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10606099","Autonomous robots;self-supervised learning;uncertainty quantification;off-road navigation","Uncertainty;Navigation;Robots;Costs;Planning;Trajectory;Semantics","","","","59","CCBY","22 Jul 2024","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, a risk-aware Volt/VAR support framework followed by a real-time reinforcement learning controller is presented for three-phase distribution systems. In the risk-aware stochastic scheduling stage, the legacy voltage regulating assets along with inverter-based photovoltaics (PVs) and energy storage system (ESS) are optimized considering day-ahead and intra-day markets. Moreover, demand response (DR) and voltage reduction plans are included in the proposed scheduling framework. By incorporating voltage-dependent load modeling in this study, the implementation of the voltage reduction plan reduces energy consumption in feeders by running the network at lower permissible voltage limits. The shiftable loads under the DR program are employed for peak shaving and to reduce operational costs. The result shows that DR implementation also reduces dependencies on the operation of traditional devices. The stochasticity of abrupt changes in PV generations is represented as the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM), indicating a non-unimodal probability distribution in day-ahead PV forecasting errors. The scenario sets for uncertain variables are then reduced using a fuzzy clustering technique. Decisions made in the scheduling, associated with PV inverters and ESS operation, are revised with a real-time controller, i.e., Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) reinforcement learning. The DDPG is adopted in the control stage of the framework considering the detailed modeling of unbalanced three-phase distribution grids to minimize the voltage deviation and power ramping of ESS. The performance of the proposed multi-stage scheme is verified using a three-phase active distribution grid under different scenarios.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3280558","U.S. Department of Energy’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE)(grant numbers:DE-EE0009022); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10138373","Demand response program;Gaussian mixture model;reinforcement learning;risk-aware scheduling;Volt/VAR support","Voltage control;Real-time systems;Optimization;Uncertainty;Stochastic processes;Load modeling;Inverters;Reactive power;Demand response;Gaussian processes;Reinforcement learning","","4","","62","CCBY","29 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This article proposes a novel online learning forecast approach to overcome the above issues to provide a better predispatch price forecast by using the online sequential extreme learning machine (OS-ELM) algorithm. The article proposes a novel data structure in the form of a 2-D orthogonal list and two corresponding OS-ELM modules.

In the second phase, the LSTM network, a commonly employed tool in predicting stock price movements, is utilized to anticipate the time series of stock closing prices. The third stage of the process focuses on stock selection and determining the appropriate weighting for each stock in the portfolio.

There have been a number of research studies that have presented bitcoin price prediction models, but none of them have looked at the controlling variables linked with bitcoin transaction timestamps. It might be that price is not the only key criteria influencing bitcoin transactions, or the available model for bitcoin price prediction is yet to consider timestamp as a determining factor in its transaction. A better and more accurate model would be required to predict how the Timestamp influences changes of bitcoin transactions. That is why this current study utilized a Nonlinear Autoregressive Exogenous (NARX) Neural Network Model for the prediction of timestamp influence on Bitcoin value. Bitcoin historical datasets which are converted to a nonlinear regression into a “well-formulated” statistical problem in the manner of a ridge regression are used. Simulation analysis indicates that bitcoin digital currency’s performance variation is highly influenced by its transaction timestamp with the prediction accuracy of 96%. The contributions of this research lies with the fact that specific Bitcoin transaction events repeat themselves over and over again, meaning that the Open-Price, High-Price, Low-Price, and Close-Price of Bitcoin price over timestamp developed a pattern that was predicted by NARX with less That means those involved in the transaction of bitcoin at the wrong timestamp will certainly face the uncertainty negative effect of the bitcoin market.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3124629","Deanship of Scientific Research (DSR), University of Jeddah, Jeddah(grant numbers:UJ-20-121-DR); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9597552","Bitcoin (digital currency);volume of BTC;bitcoin;timestamp","Bitcoin;Predictive models;Uncertainty;Bayes methods;Online banking;Computer science;Social networking (online)","","5","","57","CCBY","1 Nov 2021","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we study the stochastic volatility (SV) and stochastic volatility random jump (SVJ) models as parametric benchmarks against feedforward neural network (FNN) models, a class of neural network models. Our choice for FNN models is due to their well-studied universal approximation properties of an unknown function and its partial derivatives. Since the partial derivatives of an option pricing formula are risk pricing tools, an accurate estimation of the unknown option pricing function is essential for pricing and hedging. Our findings indicate that FNN models offer themselves as robust option pricing tools, over their sophisticated parametric counterparts in predictive settings.

In this paper, we first consider an optimistic scenario where the distribution of uncertain channel state information (CSI) can be deterministic and accurately known at the eNB. Then, a low-complexity resource allocation approach is developed, in which the probabilistic QoS constraint of V2V is transformed into a computable optimization constraint. To deal with the scenario with unknown uncertain CSI distribution, we develop a distributionally robust resource allocation approach for converting the intractable chance constraint of V2V into a deterministic semidefinite constraint based only on the first- and second-order moments of uncertain CSI. For alleviating the conservatism of above approach, a support-based distributionally robust resource allocation approach is developed to tighten the semidefinite constraint by utilizing the support information of uncertain CSI.

In this work, we propose a price prediction model based on a Bayesian neural networks with latent factor (LFBNN) in a cloud platform, which is capable of performing latent factor extraction operations on structured data of used cars as a way to remove the effect of noise in the dataset on the model performance. Moreover, the weight parameters of the Bayesian neural networks (NNs) are represented as probability distributions, which is equivalent to introducing uncertainty and acting as a regularization effect compared to a NN with fixed weights, thus making it possible to alleviate the overfitting problem. The LFBNN model uses a cloud platform for data transmission and storage, enabling it to run faster.

It is known to be very complicated and volatile. Technical analysis is the observation of past market movements with the aim of predicting future prices and dealing with the effects of market movements. A trading system is based on technical indicators derived from technical analysis. In our work, a complete trading system with a combination of trading rules on Forex time series data is developed and made available to the scientific community. The system is implemented in two phases: In the first phase, each trading rule, both the AI-based rule and the trading rules from the technical indicators, is tested for selection; in the second phase, profitable rules are selected among the qualified rules and combined. Training data is used in the training phase of the trading system. The proposed trading system was extensively trained and tested on historical data from 2010 to 2021. To determine the effectiveness of the proposed method, we also conducted experiments with datasets and methodologies used in recent work by Hernandez-Aguila et al., 2021 and by Munkhdalai et al., 2019.

However, previous approaches provide black-box solutions, which do not offer information on how confident the agent is about its decisions. An estimate of both the aleatoric and epistemic uncertainty of the agent’s decisions is fundamental for real-world applications of autonomous driving. Therefore, this paper introduces the Ensemble Quantile Networks (EQN) method, which combines distributional RL with an ensemble approach, to obtain a complete uncertainty estimate. The distribution over returns is estimated by learning its quantile function implicitly, which gives the aleatoric uncertainty, whereas an ensemble of agents is trained on bootstrapped data to provide a Bayesian estimation of the epistemic uncertainty. A criterion for classifying which decisions that have an unacceptable uncertainty is also introduced. The results show that the EQN method can balance risk and time efficiency in different occluded intersection scenarios, by considering the estimated aleatoric uncertainty. Furthermore, it is shown that the trained agent can use the epistemic uncertainty information to identify situations that the agent has not been trained for and thereby avoid making unfounded, potentially dangerous, decisions outside of the training distribution.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3251376","Volvo Group; Wallenberg Artificial Intelligence, Autonomous Systems, and Software Program (WASP) funded by the Knut and Alice Wallenberg Foundation; ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10073955","Reinforcement learning;aleatoric uncertainty;epistemic uncertainty;autonomous driving;decision-making","Uncertainty;Autonomous vehicles;Training;Decision making;Reinforcement learning;Bayes methods;Neural networks","","16","","46","IEEE","16 Mar 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Additionally, various uncertainties arising from the environment could also cause unreliable decisions, particularly in some complex urban environments. In this paper, the fully parameterized quantile network (FPQN) is utilized to estimate the full return distribution. Then, the conditional value-at-risk (CVaR) is utilized with the return distribution information to generate uncertainty-aware driving behavior. Additionally, an uncontrolled four-way intersection is developed by the Simulation of Urban Mobility (SUMO) simulation platform, which considers both the surrounding vehicles (SVs) and pedestrians. More specifically, to simulate the real-world traffic environment, the uncertainty arising from the occlusion, and the behavior uncertainty of surrounding traffic participants are also considered.

Markowitz's mean-variance analysis is one of the most well-known and widely adopted techniques for this problem. However, it requires accurate estimations of both the mean and variance of the return, while predicting the variance is particularly difficult. In this article, we propose a novel portfolio selection strategy based on a graph-aware Gaussian process model equipped with generalized Gaussian distribution (GGD) likelihood. Our method unleashes the potential of mean-variance analysis by exploiting the Gaussian process model's ability in capturing uncertainty, and the graph information is also incorporated so that correlation among different assets can be utilized. We notice that most existing financial models assume the returns follow the log-normal distribution, whereas we observe that it cannot perfectly explain real-world market data. Based on this discovery, we introduce the GGD as the likelihood function. We further improve our method by proposing a passive variant to address transaction fees, and designing the mean function of the Gaussian process with the mean reversion principle.

The resulting topics act as explanatory variables for the regression of the numerical time series, which allows us to understand the time series movements based on the events described on the text data. We have tested our model on two datasets: first, we used political news to explain the US president’s disapproval ratings; then, we considered a corpus of economic news to explain the financial returns of 4 different multinational corporations. Our experiments show that an appropriate selection of hyperparameters (via repeated random subsampling validation and Bayesian optimization) leads to significant correlations: both an intrinsic baseline and state of the art methods were significantly outperformed by TSITM in MSE, MAE and out-of-sample  $R^{2}$ , according to our hypothesis tests.

However, safety remains a critical hurdle in the way of commercialization and widespread deployment of autonomous vehicles on public roads. Safety concerns require the autonomous driving system to handle uncertainties from multiple sources that are either preexisting, e.g., the stochastic behavior of traffic participants or scenario occlusion, or introduced as a result of processing, e.g., the application of neural networks. Thus, it is crucial to analyze the sources of uncertainties and quantify the risks associated with them, including the propagated risks that accumulate in the decision-making system. In this context, this paper provides an overview of uncertainty challenges and state-of-the-art techniques for mitigating these challenges. We argue that the uncertainties mainly originate from two aspects: 1) the external traffic environment, and 2) the internal autonomous driving system. Specifically, this paper first analyzes the safety challenges caused by the uncertainties and summarizes their sources. In addition, the corresponding techniques that mitigate and quantify the risk of uncertainties are presented. Finally, research perspectives are highlighted to facilitate future studies for guaranteeing the safety of autonomous vehicles.","1558-0016","","10.1109/TITS.2023.3270887","National Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:52072215,52072051,U1964203); National Key Research and Development Program of China(grant numbers:2020YFB1600303); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10122777","Autonomous driving;uncertainty challenges;mitigation techniques;future perspectives","Uncertainty;Safety;Autonomous vehicles;Task analysis;Decision making;Roads;Pipelines","","19","","242","IEEE","10 May 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Although some researchers have experimentally demonstrated its ability to make a profit, it is still insufficient to use in real situations because existing studies have failed to answer how risky investment decisions are. Furthermore, even though the objective of PM is to maximize returns within a risk tolerance, they overlook the predictive uncertainty of DNNs in the process of risk management. To overcome these limitations, we propose a novel framework called risk-sensitive multiagent network (RSMAN), which includes risk-sensitive agents (RSAs) and a risk adaptive portfolio generator (RAPG). Standard DNNs do not understand the risks of their decision, whereas RSA can take risk-sensitive decisions by estimating market uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Acting as a trader, this agent is trained via reinforcement learning from dynamic trading simulations to estimate the distribution of reward and via unsupervised learning to assess parameter uncertainty without labeled data. We also present an RAPG that can generate a portfolio fitting the user’s risk appetite without retraining by exploiting the estimated information from the RSAs.

Therefore, we propose a data-driven, self-adaptive evolutionary bubble prediction algorithm named WSADF. First, according to the invariance principle, we speculate that if there are inherent degrees of freedom for high dimensional time series, then comovement causality analysis (CCA) can be improved to select the decisive high dimensional time series that must reflect the prominent comovement causality. The optimization problem of the high dimensional space can be solved in the low dimensional space and maintain the inherent relationships among the time series by using CCA. Second, the learning parameters of hidden neurons have the ability of self-adaptive differential evolution. The neurons in the network are used to model the individuals’ signals from the perspective of evolution. Third, a self-adaptive evolutionary neural network can be used to simulate the operation of the entire market’s signals. The generalized sup augmented Dickey–Fuller test is improved to suit changing market environmental conditions. Thus, the WSADF algorithm has the ability to predict multiple bubbles in high dimensional space.

To address such challenges, it is necessary to quickly determine response strategies to the changing intentions of surrounding vehicles. This letter proposes a new policy optimization method for safe driving using graph-based interaction-aware constraints. In this framework, the motion prediction and control modules are trained simultaneously while sharing a latent representation that contains a social context. To reflect social interactions, we illustrate the movements of agents in graph form and filter the features with the graph convolution networks. This helps preserve the spatiotemporal locality of adjacent nodes. Furthermore, we create feedback loops to combine these two modules effectively. As a result, this approach encourages the learned controller to be safe from dynamic risks and renders the motion prediction robust to abnormal movements. In the experiment, we set up a navigation scenario comprising various situations with CARLA, an urban driving simulator. The experiments show state-of-the-art performance on navigation strategy and motion prediction compared to the baselines.","2377-3766","","10.1109/LRA.2022.3227862","Challengeable Future Defense Technology Research and Development Program; Agency for Defense Development; Defense Acquisition Program Administration(grant numbers:915034201); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9976203","Integrated planning and learning;reinforcement learning;robot safety","Costs;Vehicle dynamics;Safety;Planning;Dynamics;Spatiotemporal phenomena;Roads","","4","","33","IEEE","8 Dec 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Blockchain technology prevents illegal transactions, but cannot detect these transactions. Anomaly detection is a fundamental technique for recognizing potential fraud. The heuristic and signature-based approaches were the foundation of earlier detection techniques, but tragically, these methods were insufficient to explore the entire complexity of anomaly detection. Machine Learning (ML) is a promising approach to anomaly detection, as it can be trained on large datasets of known malware samples to identify patterns and features of the transactions. Researchers are focusing on determining an efficient fraud and security threat detection model that overcomes the drawbacks of the existing methods. Therefore, ensemble learning can be applied to anomaly detection in Bitcoin by combining multiple ML classifiers. In the proposed model, the ADASYN-TL (Adaptive Synthetic + Tomek Link) balancing technique is used for data balancing. Random search, grid search and Bayesian optimization are used for hyperparameter tuning. The hyperparameters have a great impact on the performance of the model. For classification, we used the stacking model by combining Decision Tree, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest. We used SHapley Additive exPlanation (SHAP) to interpret the predictions of the stacking model. The model also explores the performance of different classifiers using accuracy, F1-score, Area Under Curve-Receiver Operating Characteristic (AUC-ROC), precision, recall, False Positive Rate (FPR) and execution time, and ultimately selects the ideal model. The proposed model contributes to the development of effective fraud detection models that address the limitations of the existing algorithms.

Equally importantly, if these alternative approaches perform better, why? And how do they stack up relative to each other? The answers to these questions are significant for predictive modeling in the financial arena, and in general for problem domains characterized by significant nonlinearities. In this paper, we compare the four above-mentioned nonlinear methods along a number of criteria.

Based on the dynamic procedure, four distinct calibration models are proposed by using Bayesian method, among which Model I and Model II are used for comparison, Model III simultaneously uses the data of underlying asset, put and call options by introducing the bivariate normal distribution, and Model IV simplifies Model III by employing the put-call parity. The results of numerical experiments and empirical analysis illustrate that Model III is the most accurate but time consuming, while Model IV is the most efficient. Dynamic calibration method is also verified to be much more accurate in data fitting and option pricing than the commonly used global calibration. Overall, the dynamically calibrated Black-Scholes model can be regarded as an improvement on the classic Black-Scholes model, where model coefficients are functions of time.

However, cohort biases remain a significant challenge in machine learning. The narrow origin of data sampling or human annotators in cohorts is a prevalent issue for machine learning researchers due to its potential to induce bias in the final product. During the development of the CryptoLin corpus for another research project, the authors became concerned about the potential influence of cohort bias on the selection of annotators. Therefore, this paper addresses the question of whether cohort diversity improves the labeling result through the implementation of a repeated annotator process, involving two annotator cohorts and a statistically robust comparison methodology. The utilization of statistical tests, such as the Chi-Square Independence test for absolute frequency tables, and the construction of confidence intervals for Kappa point estimates, facilitates a rigorous analysis of the differences between Kappa estimates. Furthermore, the application of a two-proportion z-test to compare the accuracy scores of UTAD and IE annotators for various pre-trained models, including Vader Sentiment Analysis, TextBlob Sentiment Analysis, Flair NLP library, and FinBERT Financial Sentiment Analysis with BERT, contributes to the advancement of knowledge in this field. The paper utilizes Cryptocurrency Linguo (CryptoLin), a corpus containing 2683 cryptocurrency-related news articles spanning more than three years, and compares two different selection criteria for the annotators. CryptoLin was annotated twice with discrete values representing negative, neutral, and positive news respectively. The first annotation was done by twenty-seven annotators from the same cohort. Each news title was randomly assigned and blindly annotated by three human annotators. The second annotation was carried out by eighty-three annotators from three cohorts. Each news title was randomly assigned and blindly annotated by three human annotators, one in each different cohort. In both annotations, a consensus mechanism using simple voting was applied. The first annotation used the same cohort with students from the same nationality and background. The second used three cohorts with students from a very diverse set of nationalities and educational backgrounds. The results demonstrate that manual labeling done by both groups was acceptable according to inter-rater reliability coefficients Fleiss’s Kappa, Krippendorff’s Alpha, and Gwet’s AC1. Preliminary analysis utilizing Vader, Textblob, Flair, and FinBERT confirmed the utility of the data set labeling for further refinement of sentiment analysis algorithms. Our results also highlight that the more diverse annotator pool performed better in all measured aspects.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2023.3334260","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10322757","Annotation;annotator selection criteria;cryptocurrency;news event;labeled data set;NLP;news sentiment corpus","Annotations;Cryptocurrency;Machine learning;Labeling;Finance;Sentiment analysis;Task analysis;Finance;Bit error rate","","","","31","CCBYNCND","17 Nov 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, the coefficient matrix is considered to have a low-rank structure in multivariate linear regression and multivariate quantile regression. In this paper, we propose a method called penalized matrix least squares approximation (PMLSA) toward a unified yet simple low-rank matrix estimate. Specifically, PMLSA can transform many different types of low-rank matrix estimation problems into their asymptotically equivalent least-squares forms, which can be efficiently solved by a popular matrix fast iterative shrinkage-thresholding algorithm. Furthermore, we derive analytic degrees of freedom for PMLSA, with which a Bayesian information criterion (BIC)-type criterion is developed to select the tuning parameters. The estimated rank based on the BIC-type criterion is verified to be asymptotically consistent with the true rank under mild conditions. Extensive experimental studies are performed to confirm our assertion.","2162-2388","","10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2844242","National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:11771012,11501440,61502342,91546119); Major Program of National Natural Science Foundation of China(grant numbers:71731009,71742005); China Postdoctoral Science Foundation(grant numbers:2017M610628); Key Research Program of Hunan Province, China(grant numbers:2017GK2273); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=8401536","Degrees of freedom;low-rank matrix estimate;multivariate linear regression;multivariate quantile regression (QR)","Tuning;Learning systems;Estimation;Computational modeling;Task analysis;Robustness;Least squares approximation","","11","","50","IEEE","2 Jul 2018","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

A subset of these applications is intelligent crowd-forecasting applications, e.g., Virustotal, for malware detection. In crowd-forecasting applications, multiple agents respond with predictions about potential future event outcome(s). These responses are then combined to assess the events collaboratively and act accordingly. Unlike conventional crowdsourcing applications that only communicate information, crowd-forecasting applications need to additionally process information to achieve a collaborative assessment. Hence, they require knowledge-based systems instead of simple storage-based ones for crowdsourcing applications. Most existing crowd-forecasting systems are centralized, leading to the inherent single point of failure and inefficient collaborative assessment. This paper presents CrowdFAB, Crowdsourced Forecasting Applications using Blockchains. We deploy a knowledge-based blockchain paradigm that transforms blockchains from simple storage to knowledge-based systems, thereby achieving crowd-forecasting requirements without centralization. In addition, we formulate a novel reputation scheme that assigns reputations to agents based on their performance. We then use this scheme when making assessments. We implement and analyze CrowdFAB in terms of overhead and security features. Further, we evaluate CrowdFAB for a collaborative malware detection use case, where multiple detectors are involved for crowd forecasting. Results demonstrate CrowdFAB's superior accuracy and other metrics performance compared to other works with the same settings.","1941-0018","","10.1109/TDSC.2023.3322038","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10271718","Blockchains;crowdsourcing;malware detection;security assessment","Blockchains;Security;Knowledge based systems;Forecasting;Crowdsourcing;Smart contracts;Probabilistic logic","","","","80","IEEE","4 Oct 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In particular, crop prediction in agriculture is critical and is chiefly contingent upon soil and environment conditions, including rainfall, humidity, and temperature. In the past, farmers were able to decide on the crop to be cultivated, monitor its growth, and determine when it could be harvested. Today, however, rapid changes in environmental conditions have made it difficult for the farming community to continue to do so. Consequently, in recent years, machine learning techniques have taken over the task of prediction, and this work has used several of these to determine crop yield. To ensure that a given machine learning (ML) model works at a high level of precision, it is imperative to employ efficient feature selection methods to preprocess the raw data into an easily computable Machine Learning friendly dataset. To reduce redundancies and make the ML model more accurate, only data features that have a significant degree of relevance in determining the final output of the model must be employed. Thus, optimal feature selection arises to ensure that only the most relevant features are accepted as a part of the model. Conglomerating every single feature from raw data without checking for their role in the process of making the model will unnecessarily complicate our model. Furthermore, additional features which contribute little to the ML model will increase its time and space complexity and affect the accuracy of the model’s output. The results depict that an ensemble technique offers better prediction accuracy than the existing classification technique.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2022.3154350","","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9721191","Agriculture;classification;crop prediction;feature selection","Crops;Zigbee;Monitoring;Soil;Temperature sensors;Security;Data models","","57","","40","CCBY","24 Feb 2022","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

Examples are Nonnegative Matrix/Tensor Factorization, Stochastic Neighbor Embedding, topic models, and Bayesian network optimization. The success of such a learning task depends heavily on a suitable divergence. A large variety of divergences have been suggested and analyzed, but very few results are available for an objective choice of the optimal divergence for a given task. Here we present a framework that facilitates automatic selection of the best divergence among a given family, based on standard maximum likelihood estimation. We first propose an approximated Tweedie distribution for the β-divergence family. Selecting the best β then becomes a machine learning problem solved by maximum likelihood. Next, we reformulate α-divergence in terms of β-divergence, which enables automatic selection of α by maximum likelihood with reuse of the learning principle for β-divergence. Furthermore, we show the connections between γ- and β-divergences as well as Renyi- and α-divergences, such that our automatic selection framework is extended to non-separable divergences. Experiments on both synthetic and real-world data demonstrate that our method can quite accurately select information divergence across different learning problems and various divergence families.","1939-3539","","10.1109/TPAMI.2014.2366144","Academy of Finland(grant numbers:251170,140398); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=6942194","information divergence;Tweedie distribution;maximum likelihood;nonnegative matrix factorization;stochastic neighbor embedding;Information divergence;tweedie distribution;maximum likelihood;nonnegative matrix factorization;stochastic neighbor embedding","Medals;Approximation methods;Tensile stress;Maximum likelihood estimation;Stochastic processes;Standards;Brain modeling","","18","","47","IEEE","31 Oct 2014","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

This approach has shown robustness through practice, but does not scale with increasing network size and generation of new transactions. Resource constrained Internet of Things (IoT) networks are incompatible with full computation of schemes like Bitcoin's PoW. Our effort proposes a first step towards an alternative consensus using machine learning-based decision-making with prediction of fraud transactions to alleviate need for intense computation. To improve base approval probabilities for fraud detection in an ideal security setting, Vector GAN (VecGAN) is proposed to augment blockchain data in classifier training, which combines error-driven learning with Bayesian estimation to alleviate calculations. This two-step approach with augmentation and classification on new transactions is proposed as a novel approach to blockchain decision-making. Experimental prediction accuracy using VecGAN improved up to 3% on simplistic classifiers compared to other state-of-the-art augmentation techniques. Resource consumption in a realistic blockchain setting was reduced while improving block throughput by 50% compared to PoW. Future work will explore Sybil-spam defensive measures for realistic protocol implementation with this approach.","1558-0660","","10.1109/TMC.2023.3339384","National Fellowship Program; National Science Foundation(grant numbers:OAC-1919789); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=10342719","Blockchain;data augmentation;generative adversarial network;Internet of Things (IoT)","Blockchains;Training;Generative adversarial networks;Fraud;Protocols;Decision making;Security","","","","44","IEEE","5 Dec 2023","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

However, state-of-the-art methods are not necessarily interpretable and are therefore not fully applicable to sensitive settings in biomedical or user profiling tasks, where explicit bias detection is highly relevant. The proposed SNoRe (Symbolic Node Representations) algorithm is capable of learning symbolic, human-understandable representations of individual network nodes, based on the similarity of neighborhood hashes which serve as features. SNoRe's interpretable features are suitable for direct explanation of individual predictions, which we demonstrate by coupling it with the widely used instance explanation tool SHAP to obtain nomograms representing the relevance of individual features for a given classification. To our knowledge, this is one of the first such attempts in a structural node embedding setting. In the experimental evaluation on eleven real-life datasets, SNoRe proved to be competitive to strong baselines, such as variational graph autoencoders, node2vec and LINE. The vectorized implementation of SNoRe scales to large networks, making it suitable for contemporary network learning and analysis tasks.","2169-3536","","10.1109/ACCESS.2020.3039541","ARRS National Research Programme Knowledge Technologies(grant numbers:P2-0103); European Union’s Horizon 2020 Research and Innovation Programme under Grant 825153 project EMBEDDIA (Cross-Lingual Embeddings for Less-Represented Languages in European News Media); ARRS ERC Supplementary Grant SDM-Open; ARRS Grant for young researchers (last author); ","https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=9265235","Node embedding;feature construction;symbolic learning;interpretable machine learning","Task analysis;Signal processing algorithms;Prediction algorithms;Convolution;Classification algorithms;Sparse matrices;Convolutional neural networks","","4","","49","CCBY","20 Nov 2020","","","IEEE","IEEE Journals"

In this paper, we establish a multi-step procedure for using HMM to select stocks from the global stock market. First, the five important factors of a stock are identified and scored based on its historical performances. Second, HMM is used to predict the regimes of six global economic indicators and find the time periods in the past during which these indicators have a combination of regimes that is similar to those predicted. Then, we analyze the five stock factors of the All country world index (ACWI) in the identified time periods to assign a weighted score for each stock factor and to calculate the composite score of the five factors. Finally, we make a monthly selection of 10% of the global stocks that have the highest composite scores. This strategy is shown to outperform those relying on either ACWI, any single stock factor, or the simple average of the five stock factors.

Time dependence and volatility issues in this problem have made Hidden Markov Model (HMM) a useful tool in predicting the states of stock market. In this paper, we present an approach to predict the stock market price trend based on high-order HMM. Different from the commonly used first-order HMM, short and long-term time dependence are both considered in the high order HMM. By introducing a dimension reduction method which could transform the high-dimensional state vector of high-order HMM into a single one, we present a dynamic high-order HMM trading strategy to predict and trade CSI 300 and S&P 500 stock index for the next day given historical data. In our approach, we make a statistic of the daily returns in the history to demonstrate the relationship between hidden states and the price change trend. Experiments on CSI 300 and S&P 500 index illustrate that high-order HMM has preferable ability to identify market price trend than first-order one. Thus, the high-order HMM has higher accuracy and lower risk than the first-order model in predicting the index price trend. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Literature shows that a single model algorithm usually cannot perform satisfactorily on the foreign exchange (Forex) time series because of the market's complexity. This study develops an algorithm based on two stacked generalization models consisting of four machine-learning models. First, the optimal lags of features are found using the Fisher discriminant ratio and partial autocorrelation function. Second, one stacked model fits the bullish trends, and the other holds the bearish trends resulting from a hidden Markov model. We reinforce the predictive signals of these models by extracting relationships between currency pairs with correlation and mutual information. Lastly, the proposed algorithm constructs a portfolio based on the strength of signals dependent on correlation and mutual information. As a result, this paper compares the performance of the proposed approach with different states of the model and several established benchmarks regarding return and risk metrics. The outcomes show that the proposed model's added features-such as time series clustering, considering a range of inputs, and internal relationships among different assets-can increase its performance in the Forex market.

J	Su, Z; Yi, B				Su, Zhi; Yi, Bo			Research on HMM-Based Efficient Stock Price Prediction	MOBILE INFORMATION SYSTEMS				Article							ADAPTIVE MARKETS; MODEL; VOLATILITY	Stock market is one of the most important parts of the investment market. Compared with other industries, the stock market not only has a higher rate of return on investment but also has a higher risk, and stock price prediction has always been a close concern of investors. Therefore, the research on stock price prediction methods and how to reduce the error of stock price prediction has become a hot topic for many scholars at home and abroad. In recent years, the development of computer technology such as machine learning and econometric method makes the stock price prediction more reliable. Due to the hidden Markov nature of stock price, this paper proposes a stock price prediction method based on hidden Markov model (HMM). To be specific, since the data of stock price have continuity in time series, it is necessary to extend the discrete HMM to the continuous HMM, and then put forward the up and down trend prediction model based on the continuous HMM. The first-order continuous HMM is extended to the second-order continuous HMM, and the stock price is predicted by combining the prediction method of fluctuation range. As a result, the proposed second-order continuous HMM-based stock price prediction model is simulated on Hang Seng Index (HSI), one of the earliest stock market indexes in Hong Kong. The evaluation results on six months HSI show that the predicted value of the proposed model is very close to the actual value and outperforms three benchmarks in terms of RMSE, MAE, and R-2.

During the past two decades, nonlinear modeling techniques, such as artificial neural networks, were commonly employed to solve a variety of time-series problems. Recently, however, deep neural network has been found to be more efficient than those in many application domains. In this article, we propose a model based on deep neural networks that improves the forecasting of stock prices. We investigate the impact of combining deep learning techniques with multiresolution analysis to improve the forecasting accuracy. Our proposed model is based on an empirical wavelet transform which is shown to outperform traditional stationary wavelet transform in capturing price fluctuations at different time scales. The proposed model is demonstrated to be substantially more effective than other models when evaluated on the S&P500 stock index and Mackey-Glass time series.

Accurate stock price forecasting not only aids the government in predicting economic trends but also helps investors anticipate higher expected returns. Nevertheless, hurdles such as nonlinearity, complexity and high volatility make it a daunting task to predict stock prices. To address this issue, this study proposes a new hybrid model, termed Hierarchical Decomposition-based Forecasting Model (HDFM), to decompose and forecast stock prices in a hierarchical fashion. The model utilizes complete ensemble empirical mode decomposition with adaptive noise (CEEMDAN) for the initial decomposition of stock price time series. To enhance the predictive efficiency, sub-series with similar sample entropy from the decomposition were combined using the K-means clustering method. Through a thorough analysis, it was found that the first combined sub-series contained more high-frequency signals. Therefore, the first combined sub-series is subjected to a second decomposition with variational mode decomposition (VMD). Subsequently, the gated recurrent unit (GRU) model was used to individually predict each sub-series. The final results were obtained by merging the prediction outcomes. The proposed model was evaluated on three different stock markets. The experimental results show that the proposed model outperforms other forecasting methods across all stock indices. Moreover, ablation studies demonstrated the effectiveness of each component within the proposed model.

This is achieved by using natural language processing to create a polarity index from textual information in analyst reports. In this study, we performed time series forecasting for the created polarity index using deep learning, and clustered the forecasted values by volatility using a regime switching model. In addition, we constructed a portfolio from stock data and rebalanced it at each change point of the regime. Consequently, the investment strategy proposed in this study outperforms the benchmark portfolio in terms of returns. This suggests that the polarity index is useful for constructing stock investment strategies.

The application of conventional econometric models in prediction can incur significant errors. The fast advancement of soft computing techniques provides an alternative approach for estimating and forecasting volatile stock prices. Soft computing approaches exploit tolerance for imprecision, uncertainty, and partial truth to progressively and adaptively solve practical problems. In this study, a comprehensive review of latest soft computing tools is given. Then, examples incorporating a series of machine learning models, including both single and hybrid models, to predict prices of two representative indexes and one stock in Hong Kong's market are undertaken. The prediction performances of different models are evaluated and compared. The effects of the training sample size and stock patterns (viz. momentum and mean reversion) on model prediction are also investigated. Results indicate that artificial neural network (ANN)-based models yield the highest prediction accuracy. It was also found that the determination of optimal training sample size should take the pattern and volatility of stocks into consideration. Large prediction errors could be incurred when stocks exhibit a transition between mean reversion and momentum trend.

J	Karaca, Y; Baleanu, D; Karabudak, R				Karaca, Yeliz; Baleanu, Dumitru; Karabudak, Rana			Hidden Markov Model and multifractal method-based predictive quantization complexity models vis-a-vis the differential prognosis and differentiation of Multiple Sclerosis' subgroups	KNOWLEDGE-BASED SYSTEMS				Article						Hidden Markov Model; Viterbi algorithm; Forward-Backward algorithm; Multifractal analysis; Nonlinear stochastic processes; Computational dynamic complexityanalyses; Multiple Sclerosis' subgroups	CROSS-CORRELATION ANALYSIS; FRACTAL DIMENSION; FOREIGN-EXCHANGE; MORPHOLOGY; SYSTEMS	Hidden Markov Model (HMM) is a stochastic process where implicit or latent stochastic processes can be inferred indirectly through a sequence of observed states. HMM as a mathematical model for uncertain phenomena is applicable for the description and computation of complex dynamical behaviours enabling the mathematical formulation of neural dynamics across spatial and temporal scales. The human brain with its fractal structure demonstrates complex dynamics and fractals in the brain are characterized by irregularity, singularity and self-similarity in terms of form at different observation levels, making detection difficult as observations in real-time occurrences can be time variant, discrete, continuous or noisy. Multiple Sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune degenerative disease with time and space related dissemination, leading to neuronal apoptosis, coupled with some subtle features that could be overlooked by physicians. This study, through the proposed integrated approach with multi-source complex spatial data, aims to attain accurate prediction, diagnosis and prognosis of MS subgroups by HMM with Viterbi algorithm and Forward-Backward algorithm as the dynamic and efficient products of knowledge-based and Artificial Intelligence (AI)-based systems within the framework of precision medicine. Multifractal Bayesian method (MFM) accordingly applied to identify and eliminate "insignificant "irregularities while maintaining "significant "singularities. An efficient modelling of HMM is proposed to diagnose and predict the course of MS while using MFM method. Unlike the methods employed in previous studies, our proposed integrated novel method encompasses the subsequent approaches based on reliable MS dataset ((X) over cap) collected: (i) MFM method was applied ((X) over cap) to MS dataset to characterize the irregular, self-similar and significant attributes, thus, attributes with "insignificant " irregularities were eliminated and "significant " singularities were maintained. MFM-MS dataset ((X) over cap) was generated. (ii) The continuous values in the MS dataset ((X) over cap) and MFM-MS dataset ((X) over cap) were converted into discrete values through vector quantization method of the HMM (iii) Through transitional matrices, different observation matrices were computed from the both datasets. (v) Computational complexity has been computed for both datasets. (vi) The results of the HMM models based on observation matrices obtained from both datasets were compared. In terms of the integrated HMM model proposed and the MS dataset handled, no earlier work exists in the literature. The experimental results demonstrate the applicability and accuracy of our novel proposed integrated method, HMM and Multifractal (HMM-MFM) method, for the application to the MS dataset (X). Compared with conventional methods, our novel method has achieved more superiority regarding extracting subtle and hidden details, which are significant for distinguishing different dynamic and complex systems including engineering and other related applied sciences. Thus, we have aimed at pointing a new frontier by providing a novel alternative mathematical model to facilitate the critical decision-making, management and prediction processes among the related areas in chaotic, dynamic complex systems with intricate and transient states.

Then the hybrid Copula model is nested in a hidden Markov model (HMM), the risk dependences among banking, insurance, securities and trust industries are analysed, and the Copula-Garch model is constructed for empirical analysis of investment portfolio. Finally, the deep learning Markov model is adopted to predict the financial index. The results show that the mixed Copula model based on HMM is more effective than the single Copula and the mixed Copula models. The empirical structure shows that among the four major financial industries in China, the banking and insurance industries have strong interdependence and high probability of risk contagion. The investment failure rate under 95%, 97.5% and 99% confidence intervals calculated by Copula-Garch model are 4.53%, 2.17% and 1.08%, respectively. Moreover, the errors of deep learning Markov model in stock price prediction of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (sh600000), Guizhou Moutai (sh600519) and China Ping An Insurance (sh601318) are 2.56%, 2.98% and 3.56% respectively, which indicates that the four major financial industries in China have strong interdependence and risk contagion, so that the macro or systemic risks may arise, and the deep-learning Markov model can be adopted to predict the stock prices.

In our proposed study, six supervised machine learning (ML) strategies and deep learning (DL) models with long short-term memory (LSTM) of data science was deployed for thorough analysis and measurement of the performance of the technology stocks. Under discussion are Apple Inc. (AAPL), Microsoft Corporation (NVDA), and Avigilon Corporation (AVGO). The datasets were taken from the Yahoo Finance API from 06-052005 to 06-05-2022 (seventeen years) with 4280 samples. As already noted, multiple studies have been performed to resolve this problem using linear regression, support vector machines, deep long short-term memory (LSTM), and many other models. In this research, the Hidden Markov Model (HMM) outperformed other employed machine learning ensembles, tree-based models, the ARIMA (Auto Regressive Integrated Moving Average) model, and long short-term memory with a robust mean accuracy score of 99.98. Other statistical analyses and measurements for machine learning ensemble algorithms, the Long Short-Term Model, and ARIMA were also carried out for further investigation of the performance of advanced models for forecasting time series data. Thus, the proposed research found the best model to be HMM, and LSTM was the second-best model that performed well in all aspects. A developed model will be highly recommended and helpful for early measurement of technology stock performance for investment or withdrawal based on the future stock rise or fall for creating smart environments.

J	Li, LX; Muwafak, BM				Li, Liangxiong; Muwafak, Bishr Muhamed			Adoption of deep learning Markov model combined with copula function in portfolio risk measurement	APPLIED MATHEMATICS AND NONLINEAR SCIENCES				Article; Early Access						mixed copula model; HMM; financial index; risk contagion; investment failure rate		In order to accurately describe the risk dependence structure and correlation between financial variables, a scientific financial risk assessment was carried out, and the basis for accurate financial decision-making was provided; the basic theory of copula function is established first, and the mixed copula model is constructed; then, the hybrid copula model is nested in a hidden Markov model (HMM); the risk dependences among banking, insurance, securities and trust industries are analysed, and the Copula-Garch model is constructed for empirical analysis of investment portfolio; finally, the deep learning Markov model is adopted to predict the financial index. The results show that the mixed copula model based on the HMM is more effective than the single copula model and the mixed copula model. The empirical structure shows that among the four major financial industries in China, banking and insurance industries have strong interdependence and a high probability of risk contagion. The investment failure rate under 95%, 97.5% and 99% confidence intervals calculated by the Copula-Garch model is 4.53%, 2.17% and 1.08%, respectively. Moreover, the errors of the deep learning Markov model in stock price prediction of Shanghai Pudong Development Bank (sh600000), Guizhou Moutai (sh600519) and China Ping An Insurance (sh601318) are 2.56%, 2.98% and 3.56%, respectively, which indicates that the four major financial industries in China have strong interdependence and risk contagion so that the macro or systemic risks may arise, and the deep learning Markov model can be adopted to predict the stock prices.

The prices of cryptocurrencies are highly volatile and follow stochastic moments and have reached their unpredictable limits. They are commonly used for investment and have become a substitute for other types of investment like metals, estates, and the stock market. Their importance in the market raises the strict requirement for a sturdy forecasting model. However, cryptocurrency price prediction is quite challenging due to its dependency on other cryptocurrencies. Many researchers have used machine learning and deep learning models, and other market sentiment-based models to predict the price of cryptocurrencies. As all the cryptocurrencies belong to a specific class, we can infer that the increase in the price of one cryptocurrency can lead to a price change for other cryptocurrencies. Researchers had also utilized the sentiments from tweets and other social media platforms to increase the performance of their proposed system. Motivated by these, in this paper, we propose a hybrid and robust framework, DL-Gues, for cryptocurrency price prediction, that considers its interdependency on other cryptocurrencies and also on market sentiments. We have considered price prediction of Dash carried out using price history and tweets of Dash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin for various loss functions for validation. Further, to check the usability of DL-GuesS on other cryptocurrencies, we have also inferred results for price prediction of Bitcoin-Cash with the price history and tweets of Bitcoin-Cash, Litecoin, and Bitcoin.

Based on the 5-min high-frequency trading data of China's crude oil futures market in recent 3 years, this paper uses the EMD-MFDFA model combined with multifractal detrended fluctuation analysis (MF-DFA) and empirical mode decomposition unsupervised K-means clustering and Gaussian mixture model (GMM) to identify the risk status of each trading day. Further, Support vector machine (SVM), extreme gradient lifting (XGBoost) and their improved algorithms are used to predict the risk state of China's crude oil futures market. The empirical results are as follows: first, There are obvious multifractal features in the return rate series of China's crude oil futures market and its single trading day; Second, compared with the traditional SVM model, the improved Twin Support Vector Machine (TWSVM) based on solving the sample imbalance issue has better prediction ability for China's crude oil futures risk.; Third, The XGBoost has a great impact on the prediction of China's crude oil risk, and the Focal-XGBoost with focal loss function performs the best in predicting the risk of China's crude oil futures market.

This holds immense value for investors, as it empowers them to make data-driven decisions. Identifying current and future trends in multi-class forecasting techniques employed within financial markets, particularly profitability analysis as an evaluation metric is important. The review focuses on examining stud-ies conducted between 2018 and 2023, sourced from three prominent academic databases. A meticulous three-stage approach was employed, encompassing the systematic planning, conduct, and analysis of the se-lected studies. Specifically, the analysis emphasizes technical assessment, profitability analysis, hybrid mod-eling, and the type of results generated by models. Articles were shortlisted based on inclusion and exclusion criteria, while a rigorous quality assessment through ten quality criteria questions, utilizing a Likert-type scale was employed to ensure methodological robustness. We observed that ensemble and hybrid models with long short-term memory (LSTM) and support vector machines (SVM) are being more adopted for financial trends and price prediction. Moreover, hybrid models employing AI algorithms for feature engineering have great potential at par with ensemble techniques. Most studies only employ performance metrics and lack utilization of profitability metrics or investment or trading strategy (simulated or real-time). Similarly, research on multi-class or output is severely lacking in financial forecasting and can be a good avenue for future research.

Bitcoin is a computer file stored in digital wallet applications where each transaction is secured using strong cryptographic algorithms. It was challenging to forecast the future price of bitcoin due to its nonlinearity and extreme volatility. Several recent classic parametric models have been found with limited accuracy. To address the limitations and fill the existing research gaps, there is a need for a good prediction model which will provide the desired accuracy in the case of uncertainty and dynamism. This research suggested a deep learning-based framework for predicting and forecasting Bitcoin price. The research will be helpful for worldwide consumers and industries to take their decision on whether to invest or not. The research utilizes Yahoo! finance dataset for the period of 01-03-2016 to 26-02-2021 having 1828 samples. The experimental outcomes of the proposed Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model outperformed similar deep learning models by securing minimum loss and confirming that it can be used for future price prediction of the cryptocurrencies, which is helpful for the buyer to take their decision.

Among them, SVM is the most representative method that models and forecasts financial time series. However, SVM cannot reflect on the dynamic characteristic of financial time series effectively due to its superior generalization performance. And we cannot guarantee that the parameters of SVM have the optimum values, since they are locally searched owing to the limited time bound. These vulnerabilities are the main factors that degenerates the forecasting performance of SVM. On the other hand, continuous HMM can effectively capture the irregular and dynamic movement of financial time series with a non-stationary property, since it models a financial time series stochastically, rather than deterministically. Therefore, this paper suggests a new method that constructs the trend forecasting model of financial time series. It firstly detects PIPs indicating the significant turnabout of trend in each financial time series. And then the detected PIPs are used to construtct its trend forecasting model based on continuous HMM. In the experiment with various financial time series datasets we demonstrate its superiority.

An image processing and machine learning solution to automate Egyptian cotton lint grading	TEXTILE RESEARCH JOURNAL				Article						Digital manufacturing; machine learning; Industry 4; 0; optical imaging; cotton lint; industrial crop	ARTIFICIAL-INTELLIGENCE; COLOR; PREDICTION; MODELS; SYSTEM; TRASH	Egyptian cotton is one of the most important commodities for the Egyptian economy and is renowned globally for its quality, which is largely assessed and graded by manual inspection. This grading has several drawbacks, including significant labor requirements, low inspection efficiency, and influence from inspection conditions such as light and human subjectivity. This work proposes a low-cost solution to replace manual inspection with classification models to grade Egyptian cotton lint using images captured by a charge-coupled device camera. While this method has been evaluated for classifying US and Chinese upland cotton staples, it has not been tested on Egyptian cotton, which has unique characteristics and grading requirements. Furthermore, the methodology to develop these classification models has been expanded to include image processing techniques that remove the influence of trash on color measurements and extract features that capture the intra-sample variance of the cotton samples. Three different supervised machine learning algorithms were evaluated: artificial neural networks; random forest; and support vector machines. The highest accuracy models (82.13-90.21%) used a random forest algorithm. The models' accuracy was limited by the human error associated with labeling the cotton samples used to develop the classification models. Unsupervised machine learning methods, including k-means clustering, hierarchical clustering, and Gaussian mixture models, were used to indicate where labeling errors occurred.

All those emotions and opinions are described by the word Sentiment. In finance, stochastic changes might occur according to investors sentiment levels. In this study, our main goal is to apply several operational research techniques and analyze these techniques' accurance. Firstly, we represent the mutual effects between some financial process and investors sentiment with multivariate adaptive regression splines (MARS) model. Furthermore, we consider to extend this model by using distinct data mining techniques and compare the gain in accuracy and computational time with its strong alternatives applied in the analyses of the financial data. Hence, the goal of this study is to compare the forecasting performance of sentiment index by using two-stage MARS-NN (neural network), MARS-RF (random forest), RF-MARS, RF-NN, NN-MARS, and NN-RF hybrid models. Furthermore, we aim to classify the peoples' feelings about economy according to their confidence levels. Moreover, to forecast the underlying state change of the consumer confidence index (CCI) and to observe the relationship with some macroeconomic data (CPI, GDP and currency rate) at a monthly interval, we apply hidden Markov model (HMM). The aim is to detect the switch between these states and to define a path of these states. We also aim to use volatility models for mainly sentiment index, consumer confidence index, and other indices so that we can get better forecasting results from those datasets.

Agents in the system represent traders performing buy and sell orders in a market, and fuzzy systems are used to model the rules followed by traders performing trades in a live market and intuitionistic fuzzy logic to model their decisions' indeterminacy. We use functions to restrict the agents' decisions, which make the agents become specialized at particular market conditions. These "specialization" functions use the grades of membership obtained from an agent's fuzzy system and thresholds obtained from training data sets, to determine if that agent is specialized enough to handle a market's current conditions. We have performed experiments and compared against the state of the art. Results demonstrate that our method obtains predictive errors (using mean absolute error) that are in the same order of magnitude than those errors obtained by models generated using deep learning and models generated by random forest, AdaBoost, XGBoost, and support-vector machines. Furthermore, we performed experiments that show that identifying specialized agents yields better results.

Conventional statistical modeling techniques are not adequate for stock trend forecasting because of the non-stationarity and non-linearity of the stock market. With this regard, many machine learning approaches are used to improve the prediction results. These approaches mainly focus on two aspects: regression problem of the stock price and prediction problem of the turning points of stock price. In this paper, we concentrate on the evaluation of the current trend of stock price and the prediction of the change orientation of the stock price in future. Then, a new approach named status box method is proposed. Different from the prediction issue of the turning points, the status box method packages some stock points into three categories of boxes which indicate different stock status. And then, some machine learning techniques are used to classify these boxes so as to measure whether the states of each box coincides with the stock price trend and forecast the stock price trend based on the states of the box. These results would support us to make buying or selling strategies. Comparing with the turning points prediction that only considered the features of one day, each status box contains a certain amount of points which represent the stock price trend in a certain period of time. So, the status box reflects more information of stock market. To solve the classification problem of the status box, a special features construction approach is presented. Moreover, a new ensemble method integrated with the AdaBoost algorithm, probabilistic support vector machine (PSVM), and genetic algorithm (GA) is constructed to perform the status boxes classification. To verify the applicability and superiority of the proposed methods, 20 shares chosen from Shenzhen Stock Exchange (SZSE) and 16 shares from National Association of Securities Dealers Automated Quotations (NASDAQ) are applied to perform stock trend prediction. The results show that the status box method not only have the better classification accuracy but also effectively solve the unbalance problem of the stock turning points classification. In addition, the new ensemble classifier achieves preferable profitability in simulation of stock investment and remarkably improves the classification performance compared with the approach that only uses the PSVM or back-propagation artificial neural network (BPN).

The improved accuracy of a prediction model even with a slight margin can translate into considerable monetary returns. However, the stock markets' prediction is regarded as an intricate research problem for the noise, complexity and volatility of the stocks' data. In recent years, the deep learning models have been successful in providing robust forecasts for sequential data. We propose a novel deep learning -based hybrid classification model by combining peephole LSTM with temporal attention layer (TAL) to accurately predict the direction of stock markets. The daily data of four world indices including those of U.S., U.K., China and India, from 2005 to 2022, are examined. We present a comprehensive evaluation with preliminary data analysis, feature extraction and hyperparameters' optimization for the problem of stock market prediction. TAL is introduced post peephole LSTM to select the relevant information with respect to time and enhance the performance of the proposed model. The prediction performance of the proposed model is compared with that of the benchmark models CNN, LSTM, SVM and RF using evaluation metrics of accuracy, precision, recall, F1 -score, AUC-ROC, PR-AUC and MCC. The experimental results show the superior performance of our proposed model achieving better scores than the benchmark models for most evaluation metrics and for all datasets. The accuracy of the proposed model is 96% and 88% for U.K. and Chinese stock markets respectively and it is 85% for both U.S. and Indian markets. Hence, the stock markets of U.K. and China are found to be more predictable than those of U.S. and India. Significant findings of our work include that the attention layer enables peephole LSTM to better identify the long-term dependencies and temporal patterns in the stock markets' data. Profitable and timely trading strategies can be formulated based on our proposed prediction model.

However, the real stock market is affected by the objective economic environment, investors' expected return and other potential factors, which makes the classical portfolio strategy face more challenges and pressures. How to build a reliable portfolio strategy in an uncertain environment will be a scientific problem worthy of in-depth discussion. To address this issue, this paper combines machine learning with rough set to establish a new rough set theory prediction model, quantitatively dividing the stock data into three categories and targetedly predicting the future trend according to the complexity. Based on the proposed prediction model, a new portfolio strategy is proposed by integrating the mean-variance model. Firstly, for reducing the volatility and noise of the original data of stock price, outlier processing (OP) and wavelet denoising (WD) are utilized. Secondly, for the sake of pertinently forecasting the future trend of different characteristic stock price, a three-way prediction (TWP) decisions approach is constructed based on multiscale permutation entropy (MPE), probabilistic rough set (PRS), variational modal decomposition (VMD) and deep learning. Finally, 20 stocks of Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges are taken as research samples to verify the scientificity and rationality of the portfolio strategy. The results show that the proposed approach not only provides scientific support and reference for investors' investment decisions, but also provides a new investment strategy theory and method for the investment decisions of the stock market.

This study proposes a deep learning based hybrid approach combining convolutional neural network (CNN), attention mechanism (AM), and gated recurrent unit (GRU) to predict short-term market trends (1 day, 3 days, 7 days, 10 days) across different stock indices (BSE, HSI, IXIC, NIFTY, N225, SSE). The architecture dynamically weights the input sequence with the AM model, captures local patterns through CNN and effectively models long-term dependencies with GRU thus aiming to accurately classify either "buy" or "sell" positions of stocks. The model is assessed using classification and financial evaluation metrics involving accuracy, precision, recall, f1-score, annualized returns, maximum drawdown, and return on investment. It outperforms benchmark models, and different technical indicators including average directional index, rate of change, moving average convergence divergence, and the buy-and-hold strategy, demonstrating its effectiveness in various market conditions. The proposed model achieves an average accuracy of 98% in predicting the 1 day-ahead direction, and an average accuracy of 88.53% across all prediction intervals. The model was also validated using the wilcoxon signed rank test that further supported its significance over the benchmark models. The CAG model presents a comprehensive and intuitive approach to stock market trend prediction, with potential applications in real-world asset decision-making.

The stock market is one of the leading financial markets due to importance and interest of many stakeholders. With the development of machine learning techniques, the financial industry thrived with the enhancement of the forecasting ability. Probabilistic neural network (PNN) is a promising machine learning technique which can be used to forecast financial markets with a higher accuracy. A major limitation of PNN is the assumption of Gaussian distribution as the distribution of input variables which is violated with respect to financial data. The main objective of this study is to improve the standard PNN by incorporating a proper multivariate distribution as the joint distribution of input variables and addressing the multi-class imbalanced problem persisting in the directional prediction of the stock market. This model building process is illustrated and tested with daily close prices of three stock market indices: AORD, GSPC and ASPI and related financial market indices. Results proved that scaled t distribution with location, scale and shape parameters can be used as more suitable distribution for financial return series. Global optimization methods are more appropriate to estimate better parameters of multivariate distributions. The global optimization technique used in this study is capable of estimating parameters with considerably high dimensional multivariate distributions. The proposed PNN model, which considers multivariate scaled t distribution as the joint distribution of input variables, exhibits better performance than the standard PNN model. The ensemble technique: multi-class undersampling based bagging (MCUB) was introduced to handle class imbalanced problem in PNNs is capable enough to resolve multi-class imbalanced problem persisting in both standard and proposed PNNs. Final model proposed in the study with proposed PNN and proposed MCUB technique is competent in forecasting the direction of a given stock market index with higher accuracy, which helps stakeholders of stock markets make accurate decisions.

Stock market prediction is a major challenge owing to non-stationary, blaring, and chaotic data, and thus, the prediction becomes challenging among the investors to invest the money for making profits. Several techniques are devised in the existing techniques to predict the stock market trends. This work presents the detailed review of 50 research papers suggesting the methodologies, like Bayesian model, Fuzzy classifier, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier, Neural Network (NN), Machine Learning Methods and so on, based on stock market prediction. The obtained papers are classified based on different prediction and clustering techniques. The research gaps and the challenges faced by the existing techniques are listed and elaborated, which help the researchers to upgrade the future works. The works are analyzed using certain datasets, software tools, performance evaluation measures, prediction techniques utilized, and performance attained by different techniques. The commonly used technique for attaining effective stock market prediction is ANN and the fuzzy-based technique. Even though a lot of research efforts, the current stock market prediction technique still have many limits. From this survey, it can be concluded that the stock market prediction is a very complex task, and different factors should be considered for predicting the future of the market more accurately and efficiently.

Different classical approaches that depend on existing approaches and assumptions, generative AI controls advanced deep learning (DL) approaches like generative adversarial networks (GANs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to identify designs and connections in time series data. DL has accomplished major success in optimizing performances connected with AI. In the financial area, it can be extremely utilized for the stock market predictive, trade implementation approaches, and set of optimizers. Stock market predictive is the most important use case in this field. GANs with advanced AI approaches have become more significant in recent times. However, it can be utilized in image-image-translation and other computer vision (CV) conditions. GANs could not utilized greatly for stock market prediction because of their effort to establish the proper set of hyperparameters. This study develops an integrated spotted hyena optimization algorithm with generative artificial intelligence for time series forecasting (SHOAGAI-TSF) technique. The purpose of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique is to accomplish a forecasting process for the utilization of stock price prediction. The SHOAGAI-TSF technique uses probabilistic forecasting with a conditional GAN (CGAN) approach for the prediction of stock prices. The CGAN model learns the data generation distribution and determines the probabilistic prediction from it. To boost the prediction results of the CGAN approach, the hyperparameter tuning can be performed by the use of the SHOA. The simulation result analysis of the SHOAGAI-TSF technique takes place on the stock market dataset. The experimental outcomes determine the significant solution of the SHOAGAI-TSF algorithm with other compared methods in terms of distinct metrics.

To address this issue, a stochastic multilayer perceptron (S-MLP) model has been developed to simulate the stock market's stochastic nature. By incorporating a Gaussian process into the sigmoid activation function, this model incorporates stochasticity into the traditional multilayer perceptron (MLP). As the perturbation factor, a stochastic sigmoid activation function (SAF) with a volatility estimator is used. Although S-MLP has demonstrated superiority over MLP, there is still room for improvement in terms of forecasting precision. In this study, we propose S-MLP with a trainable perturbation factor (S-MLPT), an improved variant of SMLP. SAF employs the Yang-Zhang volatility estimator as the perturbation factor. The proposed model first employed MLP, and all the parameters were trained. After freezing the parameters, SMLP is used to train the perturbation factor in the SAF. To evaluate the predictive performance of the models, MLP, S-MLP, and S-MLPT are used to predict the one day ahead highest stock price of four counters listed in Bursa Malaysia. As an evaluation metric, the coefficient of determination is utilised, and the relative percentage improvement of the models is calculated to determine their superiority. The results demonstrated that S-MLP outperforms MLP by effectively minimizing the loss function and converging towards a better local or global minimum during training. In conclusion, S-MLPT exhibits even better performance than S-MLP, with relative percentage improvements of 0.14%, 15.45%, and 0.48% for counters 0166.KL, 2445.KL, and 4707.KL, respectively.

In the financial domain, it is widely used for stock market prediction, trade execution strategies and portfolio optimization. Stock market prediction is a very significant use case in this domain. Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with advanced AI models have gained significance of late. However, it is used in image-image-translation and other computer vision scenarios. GANs are not used much for stock market prediction due to its difficulty in setting the right set of hyperparameters. In this paper, overcome this problem with reinforcement learning and Bayesian optimization. A deep learning framework based on GAN, named Stock-GAN, is implemented with generator and discriminator. The former is realized with LSTM, a variant of Recurrent Neural Network (RNN), while the latter uses Convolutional Neural Network. An algorithm named Generative Adversarial Network based Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (GAN-HPA) is proposed. An empirical study revealed that Stock-GAN achieves promising performance in stock price prediction when compared with the state of the art model known as Multi-Model based Hybrid Prediction Algorithm (MM-HPA). Afterwards, MM-HPA and GAN-HPA combined to form yet another hybrid model known as MMGAN-HPA for improved performance over MM-HPA and GAN-HPA.(c) 2021 The Authors.

J	Chandra, R; He, YX				Chandra, Rohitash; He, Yixuan			Bayesian neural networks for stock price forecasting before and during COVID-19 pandemic	PLOS ONE				Article							PREDICTION; MARKET	Recently, there has been much attention in the use of machine learning methods, particularly deep learning for stock price prediction. A major limitation of conventional deep learning is uncertainty quantification in predictions which affect investor confidence. Bayesian neural networks feature Bayesian inference for providing inference (training) of model parameters that provides a rigorous methodology for uncertainty quantification in predictions. Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling methods have been prominent in implementing inference of Bayesian neural networks; however certain limitations existed due to a large number of parameters and the need for better computational resources. Recently, there has been much progress in the area of Bayesian neural networks given the use of Langevin gradients with parallel tempering MCMC that can be implemented in a parallel computing environment. The COVID-19 pandemic had a drastic impact in the world economy and stock markets given different levels of lockdowns due to rise and fall of daily infections. It is important to investigate the performance of related forecasting models during the COVID-19 pandemic given the volatility in stock markets. In this paper, we use novel Bayesian neural networks for multi-step-ahead stock price forecasting before and during COVID-19. We also investigate if the pre-COVID-19 datasets are useful of modelling stock price forecasting during COVID-19. Our results indicate due to high volatility in the stock-price during COVID-19, it is more challenging to provide forecasting.

Our contribution to the literature is novel. In addition to applying lexicons commonly used in sentiment analysis, we devise a method using Bayesian learning to create a more context-aware and informative lexicon for Brexit. By leveraging and extending this method, we reveal the relationship between original media senti-ment and related economic and financial variables. Our method is a distinct improvement over existing methods and can better predict out-of-sample outcomes than conventional ones.

To realize accurate prediction, various methods have been tried, among which the machine learning methods have drawn attention and been developed. In this paper, we propose a basic hybridized framework of the feature weighted support vector machine as well as feature weighted K-nearest neighbor to effectively predict stock market indices. We first establish a detailed theory of feature weighted SVM for the data classification assigning different weights for different features with respect to the classification importance. Then, to get the weights, we estimate the importance of each feature by computing the information gain. Lastly, we use feature weighted K-nearest neighbor to predict future stock market indices by computing k weighted nearest neighbors from the historical dataset. Experiment results on two well known Chinese stock market indices like Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchange indices are finally presented to test the performance of our established model. With our proposed model, it can achieve a better prediction capability to Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index and Shenzhen Stock Exchange Component Index in the short, medium and long term respectively. The proposed algorithm can also be adapted to other stock market indices prediction. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

Assess deep learning models for Egyptian exchange prediction using nonlinear artificial neural networks	NEURAL COMPUTING & APPLICATIONS				Article						Artificial neural networks; Autoregressive; Bayesian regularization; Deep learning; Egyptian stock market; Levenberg-Marquardt; Stock price prediction	STOCK-MARKET PREDICTION; INDEXES; ALGORITHM	Financial analysis of the stock market using the historical data is the exigent demand in business and academia. This work explores the efficiency of three deep learning (Dl) techniques, namely Bayesian regularization (BE), Levenberg-Marquardt (lM), and scaled conjugate gradient (SCG), for training nonlinear autoregressive artificial neural networks (NARX) for predicting specifically the closing price of the Egyptian Stock Exchange indices (EGX-30, EGX-30-Capped, EGX-50-EWI, EGX-70, EGX-100, and NIlE). An empirical comparison is established among the experimented prediction models considering all techniques for the time horizon of 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 5 days and 30 days in advance, applying on all the datasets used in this study. For performance evaluation, statistical measures such as mean squared error (MSE) and correlationRare used. From the simulation result, it can be clearly suggested that BR outperforms other models for short-term prediction especially for 3 days ahead. On the other hand, lM generates better prediction accuracy than BR- and SCG-based models for long-term prediction, especially for 7-day prediction.

Initially, the collected stock market data from the benchmark sources are pre-processed using empirical wavelet transform (EWT). This pre-processed data is subjected to the prediction model based on hybrid deep learning approach by adopting Resnet and recurrent neural network (RNN). Here, the fully connected layer of Resnet is replaced with the RNN. In both the Resnet and RNN structures, the parameter is optimized using the probabilistic spider monkey optimization (P-SMO) for attaining accurate prediction. When analyzing the proposed P-SMO-ResRNN, it secures 6.27%, 12.26%, 15.13%, 13.61%, and 14.10% more than RNN, DNN, NN, KNN, and SVM, respectively, regarding the MASE analysis. Hence, the proposed model shows enhanced performance. With the elaborated model and estimation of prediction term based on several analyses, this work supports the stock analysis research community.

Design/methodology/approach This paper provides a comprehensive review of ML/FT through the stock market across developed, developing and emerging jurisdictions, sheds light on the existing literature and critically evaluates the gap in the relevant studies. Moving forward, this paper develops the conceptual framework and formulates hypotheses to explore the empirical relationship. Findings This paper advocates and finds a basis to carry out much-needed empirical research between the ML/FT and stock market keeping in view the growing criminal cases in the developing countries. This paper suggests mining proxies from the publically available stock market data and the results of existing seminal research as variables of the study. These data and results carry information about the ML determinants. After developing hypothetical research providing concepts, this paper also finds that using a suitable methodology, preferable Bayesian logistic and linear regression models, it is possible to find the typologies and factors that can indicate and endorse the use of the stock market for ML/FT. Broadly, it is found that the significance of this study will be two-pronged: empirical development and policy implications. Research limitations/implications This paper mainly focuses on the developing region, a newly emerging market and, peculiarly, a grey-listed region by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF). Practical implications In light of the existing literature and to the best of the researchers' knowledge, this study will bring into focus the new age of the action research on the ML regime in the securities markets of the developing countries, hence, the emerging markets. Moreover, this research shall have a sheer significance for the policy measures on FATF recommendations on ML and FT, especially for the countries listed as "grey". Social implications The research based on comprehensive review will help in controlling the social behaviours aiding the proceeds of ML. Originality/value This research is extremely novel to the best of the researcher's knowledge.

However, the generalization ability of some existing prediction models is weak due to the highly stochastic property of stock market, and some models suffer from the problem of gradient explosion or gradient vanishing in the training process. To solve the above issues, in this paper, we propose a novel stock movement prediction model based on gated orthogonal recurrent units (GORU) and variational auto-encoder (VAE). Specifically, GORU encodes the text information, and then VAE infers and decodes the market information formed by concatenating encoded text information with normalized historical price information. Meanwhile, orthogonality introduced by GORU can alleviate the problem of gradient explosion or gradient vanishing and enhance the generalization ability of the model. We evaluate the relative contributions of text information and historical prices with respect to prediction accuracy by the results of an ablation study. The experimental results on publicly available datasets show that the proposed model is better than several state-of-the-art models, which indicates that the GORU and VAE can effectively improve the model's generalization ability and accuracy for predicting stock trends.

J	Kim, SH; Chun, SH				Kim, SH; Chun, SH			Graded forecasting using an array of bipolar predictions: application of probabilistic neural networks to a stock market index	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF FORECASTING				Article						forecasting system; artificial intelligence; financial market forecasting		To an increasing extent over the past decade, software learning methods including neural networks have been used for prediction in financial markets and other areas. By far the most popular type of neural network has been backpropagation. However, the advantages of other learning techniques such as the swift response of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) suggest the desirability of adapting other models to the predictive function. Unfortunately, the conventional architecture for probabilistic neural networks yields only a bipolar output corresponding to Yes or No; Up or Down. This limitation may be circumvented in part by using a graded forecast of multiple discrete values. More specifically, the approach involves an architecture comprising an array of elementary PNNs with bipolar output. This paper explores a number of interrelated topics: (1) presentation of a new architecture for graded forecasting using an arrayed probabilistic network (APN); (2) use of a "mistake chart" to compare the accuracy of learning systems against default performance based on a constant prediction; and (3) evaluation of several backpropagation models against a recurrent neural network (RNN) as well as PNN, APN, and case based reasoning. These concepts are investigated against the backdrop of a practical application involving the prediction of a stock market index. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V. All rights reserved.

These models were trained with four different feature sets and their performances were evaluated in terms of accuracy and F-measure metrics. While the first experiments directly used the own stock features as the model inputs, the second experiments utilized reduced stock features through Variational AutoEncoders (VAE). In the last experiments, in order to grasp the effects of the other banking stocks on individual stock performance, the features belonging to other stocks were also given as inputs to our models. While combining other stock features was done for both own (named as allstock_own) and VAE-reduced (named as allstock_VAE) stock features, the expanded dimensions of the feature sets were reduced by Recursive Feature Elimination. As the highest success rate increased up to 0.685 with allstock_own and LSTM with attention model, the combination of allstock_VAE and LSTM with the attention model obtained an accuracy rate of 0.675. Although the classification results achieved with both feature types was close, allstock_VAE achieved these results using nearly 16.67% less features compared to allstock_own. When all experimental results were examined, it was found out that the models trained with allstock_own and allstock_VAE achieved higher accuracy rates than those using individual stock features. It was also concluded that the results obtained with the VAE-reduced stock features were similar to those obtained by own stock features.

These models are mostly used in the pre-trade analysis phase to determine the buy or sell decisions using various machine learning techniques. We aim to implement a machine learning-driven approach using various technical indicators to predict stock market prices and then accordingly make a decision about buying or selling. First, an effective trading strategy is discussed that selects the potentially profitable stocks, and then the technical indicators such as simple moving average (SMA), exponential moving average (EMA), relative strength index (RSI), and moving average convergence divergence (MACD) are calculated for those potentially profitable stocks. Then supervised machine learning algorithms such as multiple linear regression, support vector machine regression, and decision tree regression are applied, where the close price of the stock is predicted using technical indicators for the next day, and based on that buy or sell signals are generated. The model is then tested on 12 different SNP500 stocks, one for every month in 2018, with the mean squared error (MSE) varying between 30.33 and 48.16 and the root MSE varying between 5.51 and 6.93, where the error is calculated on the difference in the number of days when the stock price actually increases and the predicted number of days for various models.

Forecasting stock market index daily direction: A Bayesian Network approach	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS				Article						Stock direction prediction; Bayesian Networks; Machine learning; Applied artificial intelligence		In this work, we investigate the feasibility of Bayesian Networks as a way to verify the extent to which stock market indices from around the globe influence iBOVESPA - the main index at the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange, Brazil. To do so, index directions were input to a network designed to reflect some intuitive dependencies amongst continental markets, moving through 24 and 48 h cycles, and outputting iBOVESPA's next day closing direction. Two different network topologies were tested, with different numbers of stock indices used in each test. Best results were obtained with the model that accounts for a single index per continent, up to 24 h before iBOVESPA's closing time. Mean accuracy with this configuration was around 71% (with almost 78% top accuracy). With results comparable to those of the related literature, our model has the further advantage of being simpler and more tractable for its users. Also, along with the fact that it not only gives the next day closing direction, but also furnishes the set of indices that influence iBovespa the most, the model lends itself both to academic research purposes and as one of the building blocks in more robust decision support systems.

Developing a Novel Hybrid Model Double Exponential Smoothing and Dual Attention Encoder-Decoder Based Bi-Directional Gated Recurrent Unit Enhanced With Bayesian Optimization to Forecast Stock Price	IEEE ACCESS				Article						Predictive models; Accuracy; Forecasting; Smoothing methods; Data models; Time series analysis; Measurement; Encoders; Stock markets; Pricing; Double exponential smoothing (DES); dual attention mechanism (DA); encoder-decoder (ED); bi-directional GRU (Bi-GRU); Bayesian optimization (BO); stock price prediction		Financial market prediction has shown considerable potential in the past few years from the combination of contemporary Deep Learning (DL) techniques and traditional time series forecasting methodologies. To predict the stock prices of three distinct companies General Electric (GE), Microsoft (MSFT), and Amazon (AMZN) datasets. This study presents a novel hybrid model that combines the Double Exponential Smoothing (DES) method with a Deep Learning (DL) model Dual Attention Encoder-Decoder based Bi-directional GRU, optimized using Bayesian Optimization (DES-DA-ED-Bi-GRU-BO). By combining the best features of contemporary and old methods, the hybrid model seeks to efficiently identify patterns and trends in stock data. When handling time series data, the DES method offers a reliable and flexible mechanism that considers trends and seasonality in the data. The DA-ED-Bi-GRU added to the deep learning model further improves its comprehension of intricate patterns found in the stock data. The parameters are adjusted using Bayesian optimization (BO) to maximize the model's performance. Several performance indicators, such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), R-Square (R-2), and Theil's U-Statistics (TUS), are used to assess the effectiveness of the model. These measures offer thorough insights into the precision, dependability, and accuracy of the model's predictions. The experimental findings show that the proposed hybrid model has the ability to predict GE, MSFT, and AMZN stock values with reasonable accuracy.

The stock market is a highly complicated nonlinear system which makes it difficult to present accurate predictors. In this paper, an innovative multi-scale nonlinear ensemble paradigm is proposed for stock index prediction and uncertainty analysis, which consists of an optimal feature extraction including variational mode decomposition and auto-encoder, a two-stage deep learning based on recurrent neural network and long short-term memory, and Gaussian process regression. The optimal feature extraction is proposed to extract the optimal features of stock index fluctuations and eliminate the disturbance of illusive components. The two-stage deep learning is developed to conduct the prediction of each feature sub-signal and implement its nonlinear integration. The Gaussian process regression is utilized to construct the interval prediction of the original stock signal and analyze the uncertainties of stock market. The validity of the developed model is verified by the data from S&P 500, Dow Jones index and NASDAQ. After a series of comparisons, the mean absolute percentage errors of the proposed model in S&P 500, Dow Jones index and NASDAQ are 0.55%, 0.65% and 1.11%, respectively. These results fully verify the effectiveness of proposed model. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

Based on the finding that the dynamics of sector correlation matrices of the S&P 500 stock market can be described by a sequence of distinct states via a clustering algorithm, we try to identify the industrial sectors dominating the correlation structure of each state. For this purpose, we use a method from explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) on daily S&P 500 stock market data from 1992 to 2012 to assign relevance scores to every feature of each data point. To compare the significance of the features for the entire data set we develop an aggregation procedure and apply a Bayesian change point analysis to identify the most significant sector correlations. We show that the correlation matrix of each state is dominated only by a few sector correlations. Especially the energy and IT sector are identified as key factors in determining the state of the economy. Additionally we show that a reduced surrogate model, using only the eight sector correlations with the highest XAI-relevance, can replicate 90%	[Wand, Tobias; Hessler, Martin] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Theoret Phys, Munster, Germany; [Wand, Tobias; Hessler, Martin; Kamps, Oliver] Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Ctr Nonlinear Sci, Munster, Germany		Wand, T (corresponding author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Inst Theoret Phys, Munster, Germany.; Wand, T (corresponding author), Westfalische Wilhelms Univ Munster, Ctr Nonlinear Sci, Munster, Germany.	t_wand01@wwu.de	Heßler, Martin/AFD-6562-2022							2	2											APR 1	2023	2023	4							043402	10.1088/1742-5468/accce0	http://dx.doi.org/10.1088/1742-5468/accce0												2024-10-15	WOS:000979768700001

Machine learning models with improved prediction accuracy have elicited considerable attention from researchers in the field of financial application. An intensive empirical study is conducted to compare two methods in terms of model estimation, prediction, and domain adaptation using S&P 100 American/European put options. Results indicated that econometric jump models demonstrate better prediction performance than the best-performing machine learning models, and the estimation results of the former are similar to those of the latter. The former also exhibited significantly better domain adaptation performance than the latter regardless of domain adaptation techniques in machine learning. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

J	Chen, YC; Huang, WC				Chen, Yu-Chen; Huang, Wen-Chen			Constructing a stock-price forecast CNN model with gold and crude oil indicators	APPLIED SOFT COMPUTING				Article						Stock price forecast; Deep learning; Convolutional neural networks; Long short-term memory; Bayesian optimization	OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM; NEURAL-NETWORKS; TIME-SERIES; LSTM	In this study, we propose algorithms to predict future stock market trends based on 8 different input features, including financial technology indicators, gold prices, a gold price volatility index, crude oil price, a crude oil price volatility index, and other characteristic data using two different labeling methods with separate classification algorithms of two and three output categories, respectively including predicted stock price changes (up and down) and recommended trading actions (buy, sell, and hold), and analyze the validity of these characteristic data in terms of their ability to predict future trends. The S&P 500 (GSPC) is the target of these forecasts. Sample data from 2010 to 2018 are divided 8:2, between training and verification data, while data from 2019 are used to test the proposed approach. CNN and LSTM models are used for comparison of classification accuracy and investment returns, respectively. Bayesian optimization (BO) hyperparameters are used to improve the accuracy of the model and increase the return on investment (ROI) of the output predictions. The purpose of this study is to verify whether using gold prices, a gold volatility index, crude oil price, and a crude oil price volatility indices as input features can enable a deep learning model accurately to predict future stock price trends, and to discuss separately the applicability of CNN and LSTM models to the abovementioned characteristics and financial indicators. We also present the results of experiments conducted to evaluate the proposed method in terms of classification accuracy and confusion matrix. In the case of three-category classification, the model takes feature data as input to outputs a predicted trading order on whether to buy, sell, or hold a given set of stocks tomorrow as well as the timing of entry and exit from each position, and also backtests the data outside the sample to find the combination of characteristics and indicators best maximizing ROI. Using this three-category method, we obtain a comprehensive ROI for a given set of individual stocks and assess whether each type of stock is suitable for the prediction model based on input features such as gold and crude oil or the fields that are suitable for the given feature. Experimental results show that the proposed approach as able to predict whether stock price will rise or fall in the next 10 days, and the model accuracy rate can reach 67%. The results of experiments on the proposed combined CNN model with eight features, referred to as CNN8, achieved an ROI on 2019 data outside the sample period of up to 13.23%, which was superior to the 12.08% and 11.06% obtained by the models designed CNN4 (CNN with four input features) and LSTM8(LSTM with eight input features), respectively. The F1 score increased from 0.75 0.79 as a result of applying BO. The results indicate that considering the price of gold, the gold volatility index, crude oil price, and crude oil price volatility index can help obtain better ROI for companies in certain fields, such as the semiconductor, petroleum, and automotive industries, rather than merely considering financial indicators. However, for companies related to apparel, fast food, and copy processing, the input characteristics of purely financial technical indicators were found to be suitable. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V.

To predict the corresponding negation scope, related literature commonly utilizes rule-based algorithms and generative probabilistic models. In contrast, we propose the use of a tailored reinforcement learning method, since it can conquer learning task of arbitrary length. We then perform a thorough comparison with a two-pronged evaluation. First, we compare the predictive performance using a manually-labeled dataset. Here, reinforcement learning outperforms common approaches from the related literature, leading to a balanced classification accuracy of up to 70.17%. Second, we examine how detecting negation scopes can improve the accuracy of sentiment analysis for financial news, leading to an improvement of up to 10.63% in the correlation between news sentiment and stock market returns. This reveals negation scope detection as a crucial leverage in decision support from sentiment. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

J	Chen, NY				Chen, Ningyan			Visual recognition and prediction analysis of China's real estate index and stock trend based on CNN-LSTM algorithm optimized by neural networks	PLOS ONE				Article							DEEP LEARNING-MODELS; TECHNICAL ANALYSIS; ENSEMBLE	Today, with the rapid growth of Internet technology, the changing trend of real estate finance has brought great an impact on the progress of the social economy. In order to explore the visual identification (VI) effect of Convolutional Neural Network and Long Short-Term Memory (CNN-LSTM) algorithm based on neural network optimization on China's real estate index and stock trend, in this study, artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm is introduced to predict its trend. Firstly, LSTM algorithm can effectively solve the problem of vanishing gradient, which is suitable for dealing with the problems related to time series. Secondly, CNN, with its unique fine-grained convolution operation, has significant advantages in classification problems. Finally, combining the LSTM algorithm with the CNN algorithm, and using the Bayesian Network (BN) layer as the transition layer for further optimization, the CNN-LSTM algorithm based on neural network optimization has been constructed for the VI and prediction model of real estate index and stock trend. Through the performance verification of the model, the results reveal that the CNN-LSTM optimization algorithm has a more accurate prediction effect, the prediction accuracy is 90.55%, and the prediction time is only 52.05s. At the same time, the significance advantage of CNN-LSTM algorithm is verified by statistical method, which can provide experimental reference for intelligent VI and prediction of trend of China real estate index and property company stocks.

J	Lee, M; Seok, J				Lee, Minhyeok; Seok, Junhee			Estimation with Uncertainty via Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks	SENSORS				Article						generative adversarial network; deep learning; adversarial learning; probability estimation; risk estimation; portfolio management		Conventional predictive Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) commonly employ deterministic weight matrices; therefore, their prediction is a point estimate. Such a deterministic nature in ANNs causes the limitations of using ANNs for medical diagnosis, law problems, and portfolio management in which not only discovering the prediction but also the uncertainty of the prediction is essentially required. In order to address such a problem, we propose a predictive probabilistic neural network model, which corresponds to a different manner of using the generator in the conditional Generative Adversarial Network (cGAN) that has been routinely used for conditional sample generation. By reversing the input and output of ordinary cGAN, the model can be successfully used as a predictive model; moreover, the model is robust against noises since adversarial training is employed. In addition, to measure the uncertainty of predictions, we introduce the entropy and relative entropy for regression problems and classification problems, respectively. The proposed framework is applied to stock market data and an image classification task. As a result, the proposed framework shows superior estimation performance, especially on noisy data; moreover, it is demonstrated that the proposed framework can properly estimate the uncertainty of predictions.

Machine learning models exhibit capabilities that allow them to handle nonlinear data and be candidate tools for stock price forecasting. In this study, an empirical evaluation of eight conventional machine learning models' is conducted to forecast the stock price of eleven companies belonging to the Saudi Stock Exchange. Moreover, the optimal configuration of hyperparameters in each machine learning model is identified. Forecasting performance is evaluated by two well-known error metrics: Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE). Wilcoxson effect size is utilized to determine the impact of hyperparameter tuning by comparing tuned and un-tuned machine learning models' forecasting performance. Empirical results indicate there are varying impacts of hyperparameter tuning of machine learning models in forecasting stock price. After tuning the hyperparameters, Support Vector Regression outperforms other forecasting models with a significant statistical difference. In contrast, Kernel Ridge Regression shows noteworthy forecasting performance without hyperparameter tuning with respect to other un-tuned forecasting models. However, Decision Tree and K-Nearest Neighbour are the poor-performing models which demonstrate inadequate forecasting performance even after hyperparameter tuning.

The conjugate priors for the exponential families are considered in the analysis. The marginal posterior distribution of the change-point j is derived. Since some hyper-parameters are involved in the conjugate priors, the Type II maximum likelihood (ML-II) approach (cf. Berger, 1995) will be used to estimate these hyperparameters in applications. The method is simple and is easily applied to the Nile problem, Illinois traffic data, British coal-mining disasters, accident data and stock-market prices. (C) 1998 Elsevier Science B.V.

The traditional approach in Deep Learning when trying to predict the behavior of an asset is to take a price history, train a model, and forecast one single price in the near future. This is called the frequentist perspective. Uncertainty Quantification is an alternative in which models manage a probability distribution for prediction. It provides investors with more information than the traditional frequentist way, so they can consider the risk of making or not making a certain decision. We systematically reviewed the existing literature on Uncertainty Quantification methods in Deep Learning to predict the behavior of financial assets, such as foreign exchange, stock market, cryptocurrencies and others. The article discusses types of model, categories of financial assets, prediction characteristics and types of uncertainty. We found that, in general terms, references focus on price accuracy as a metric, although other metrics, such as trend accuracy, might be more appropriate. Very few authors analyze both epistemic and aleatoric uncertainty, and none analyze in depth how to decouple them. The time period analyzed includes the years 2001 to 2022.	[Blasco, Txus; Sanchez, J.

In this paper, we employed the state-of-the-art nonparametric machine learning models: neural networks, Bayesian neural network, Gaussian process, and support vector regression, to predict market impact cost accurately and to provide the predictive model that is versatile in the number of variables. We collected a large amount of real single transaction data of US stock market from Bloomberg Terminal and generated three independent input variables. As a result, most nonparametric machine learning models outperformed a-state-of-the-art benchmark parametric model such as I-star model in four error measures. Although these models encounter certain difficulties in separating the permanent and temporary cost directly, nonparametric machine learning models can be good alternatives in reducing transaction costs by considerably improving in prediction performance.

We derive a multivariate nonparametric and nonstationary formulation of the MaxEnt principle and show that its solution can be approximated through a numerical maximization of the sparse constrained optimization problem with regularization. Application of the resulting algorithm to popular financial benchmarks reveals memoryless models allowing for simple and qualitative descriptions of data of the major stock market indices. We compare the obtained MaxEnt models to the heteroscedastic models from computational econometrics (GARCH, GARCH-GJR, MS-GARCH, and GARCH-PML4) in terms of the model fit, complexity, and prediction quality. We compare the resulting model log-likelihoods, the values of the Bayesian information criterion, posterior model probabilities, the quality of the data autocorrelation function fits, as well as the value-at-risk prediction quality. We show that all of the seven considered major financial benchmark time series (DJI, SPX, FTSE, STOXX, SMI, HSI, and N225) are better described by conditionally memoryless MaxEnt models with nonstationary regime-switching than by the common econometric models with finite memory. This analysis also reveals a sparse network of statistically significant temporal relations for the positive and negative latent variance changes among different markets.

Failure in Stock Price Prediction: A Comparison between the Curve-Shape-Feature and Non-Curve-Shape-Feature Modes of Existing Machine Learning Algorithms	INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF COMPUTERS COMMUNICATIONS & CONTROL				Article						stock price prediction; financial time series; machine learning method; deep learn-ing method	SERIES; GARCH; VOLATILITY	In the era of artificial intelligence, machine learning methods are successfully used in various fields. Machine learning has attracted extensive attention from investors in the financial market, especially in stock price prediction. However, one argument for the machine learning methods used in stock price prediction is that they are black-box models which are difficult to interpret. In this paper, we focus on the future stock price prediction with the historical stock price by machine learning and deep learning methods, such as support vector machine (SVM), random forest (RF), Bayesian classifier (BC), decision tree (DT), multilayer perceptron (MLP), convolutional neural network (CNN), bi-directional long-short term memory (BiLSTM), the embedded CNN, and the embedded BiLSTM. Firstly, we manually design several financial time series where the future price correlates with the historical stock prices in pre-designed modes, namely the curve-shape-feature (CSF) and the non-curve-shape-feature (NCSF) modes. In the CSF mode, the future prices can be extracted from the curve shapes of the historical stock prices. Conversely, in the NCSF mode, they can't. Secondly, we apply various algorithms to those pre-designed and real financial time series. We find that the existing machine learning and deep learning algorithms fail in stock price prediction because in the real financial time series, less information of future prices is contained in the CSF mode, and perhaps more information is contained in the NCSF. Various machine learning and deep learning algorithms are good at handling the CSF in historical data, which are successfully applied in image recognition and natural language processing. However, they are inappropriate for stock price prediction on account of the NCSF. Therefore, accurate stock price prediction is the key to successful investment, and new machine learning algorithms handling the NCSF series are needed.

The MSM-t can be estimated via Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM) and volatility forecasting can be performed via Bayesian updating (ML) or best linear forecasts (GMM). Monte Carlo simulations show that using GMM plus linear forecasts leads to minor losses in efficiency compared to optimal Bayesian forecasts based on ML estimates. The forecasting capability of the MSM-t model is evaluated empirically in a comprehensive panel forecasting analysis with three different cross-sections of assets at the country level (all-share equity indices, bond indices and real estate security indices). Empirical forecasts of the MSM-t model are compared to those obtained from its Gaussian counterparts and other volatility models of the Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) family. In terms of mean absolute errors (mean squared errors), the MSM-t (Gaussian MSM) dominates all other models at most forecasting horizons for the various asset classes considered. Furthermore, forecast combinations obtained from the MSM and (Fractionally Integrated) GARCH models provide an improvement upon forecasts from single models. (C) 2010 Elsevier B.V.

Stock prediction problems are handled either as a regression or classification task. Studies in the literature have also shown success for hybrid learning to stock prediction. But little attention is paid to finding out the effect of spatial feature extraction/distortion over the temporal effect of the deep neural network and vice versa for the problem under study. The paper, therefore, proposes a hybrid long shortterm memory (LSTM) network over a convolutional neural network (CNN) called LSTM-CNN as against the popular CNN-LSTM model. The daily price movement of the S & P 500 index data is utilized. A sliding window technique is considered to obtain a balanced data of 20 -days window data from the S & P 500. The proposed stock prediction model is investigated further for an optimal set of hyperparameters using the Bayesian optimization (Bo) technique. In addition, the proposed model is compared with optimized CNN, LSTM, and CNN-LTSM models. The optimized LSTM-CNN model is found to outperform the other models with accuracy, precision, and recall values of 0.9741, 0.9684, and 0.9800, respectively. The proposed model is established to provide a better stock trend prediction.

We test Green stock index in Shanghai Stock Exchange and China Securities Index as safe-havens for global investors. Suitable multivariate-SV model and Bayesian method are used to estimate the spillover effect between different assets among local and global markets. We choose multivariate volatility model because it can efficiently simulate the spillover effect by using machine learning MCMC method. The results show that the Environmental Protection Index (EPI) of Shanghai Stock Exchange (SSE) and China Securities Index (CSI) have no significant volatility spillover from Shanghai Stock index, S &P index, gold price, oil future prices of USA and China. During COVID-19 pandemic, we find Green stock index is a suitable safe-haven with low volatility spillover. Green stock indexes has a strongly one-way spillover to the crude oil future price. Environmentally friendly investor can use diversity green assets to provide a low risk investment portfolio in EPI stock market. The DCGCt-MSV model using machine learning of MCMC method is accurate and outperform others in Bayes parameter estimation.

In particular, the volatility of their share prices is closely related to economic development and investor behaviors. Therefore, this study takes the Chinese market as an example, after constructing 34 determinants that affect the stock price, the RF, DNN, GBDT, and Adaboost models under Bayesian optimization are employed to forecast the next day's closing price of listed innovative SMEs. The number of samples is 78,708 from 337 SMEs listed on the Chinese SSE STAR market, from July 22, 2019, to September 10, 2021 period. The experimental results show the RF and DNN models perform at a better prediction level than the GBDT and Adaboost models, in terms of the evaluation indicators of R-2, RMSE, MAPE, and DA. Then K-fold method and t-tests as robustness checks ensure our experimental results are more reliable and robust.

The research is done by using two innovative methodologies - the wavelet approach and Bayesian quantile regression. By observing these four countries, we can assess whether inflation targeting (IT) plays significant role in curbing inflation, because three Visegrad group countries adopted IT almost two decades ago, while Russia started to conduct IT relatively recently. Estimated quantiles suggest that money supply growth does not influence inflation in the Czech Republic and Hungary, whatsoever. We find that money growth impacts inflation in Poland, but very modestly. On the other hand, in the case of Russia, the transmission effect from money to inflation is much higher, and it goes around 40% in low inflation conditions, when Ml aggregate is observed, and around 78% in low inflation conditions, when M3 aggregate is analysed. The overall results clearly indicate that the adoption of the IT framework as a disinflation strategy proved to be successful in the Visegrad group countries, since excessive money growth has little or no effect at all on inflation in these countries.

However, digesting a massive amount of news and data published on the Internet to predict a market can be burdensome. This paper introduces a topic model based on latent Dirichlet allocation (LDA) to discover features from a combination of text, especially news articles and financial time series, denoted as Financial LDA (FinLDA). The features from FinLDA are served as additional input features for any machine learning algorithm to improve the prediction of the financial time series. We provide posterior distributions used in Gibbs sampling for two variants of the FinLDA and propose a framework for applying the FinLDA in a text and data mining for financial time series prediction. The experimental results show that the features from the FinLDA empirically add value to the prediction and give better results than the comparative features including topic distributions from the common LDA.

The VIX is calculated using option prices for the S&P 500 Index (SPX) and is expressed as a percentage. Taking into account that VIX only shows the implicit volatility of the S&P 500 for the next 30 days, the authors develop a model for a near-optimal state trying to avoid uncertainty and insufficient accuracy. The researchers are trying to make a contribution to the theory of socially responsible portfolio management. The developed approach allows potential investments to make decisions regarding such important topics as ethical investing, performance analysis, as well as sustainable investment strategies. The approach of this research allows to use deep probabilistic convolutional neural networks based on conditional variance as a linear function of errors with the aim of estimating and predicting the VIX. For this purpose, the use of technical indicators and economic indexes such as Chicago Board Options Exchange (CBOE) VIX and S&P 500 is considered. The results of estimating and predicting the VIX with the proposed method indicate high precision and create a certainty in modeling to achieve the goals.

The efficiency and liquidity of the financial market are examined using stochastic models that incorporate information delay. Based on machine learning, we estimate the in-sample and out-of-sample forecasting price performances of the six proposed methods using the likelihood function and Bayesian methods, and the out-of-sample prediction performance is compared with the benchmark model ARIMA-GARCH. We discover that the forecasting price performance of the proposed simplified delay stochastic model is superior to that of the benchmark methods by the test methods of a variety of loss function, superior predictive ability test (SPA), Akaike information criterion (AIC), and Bayesian information criterion (BIC). Using data from the Chinese stock market, the best forecasting model assesses the efficiency and liquidity of the financial market while accounting for information delay and trade probability. The rise in trade probability and delay time affects the stability of the return distribution and raises the risk, according to stochastic simulation. The empirical findings show that empirical and best forecasting approaches are compatible, that company size and liquidity (delay time) have an inverse relationship, and that delay time and liquidity have a nonlinear relationship. The most efficient have optimal liquidity.

Several technical analysis indicators were employed as inputs to machine learning models such as Neural Networks, K Nearest Neighbor, Regression Trees, Random Forests, Naive Bayes classifiers, Bayesian Generalized Linear Models, and Support Vector Machines. Models were used to generate trading signals on WIG20, DAX, S & P500, and selected CEE indices in the period between 200201-01 and 2023-03-31. Strategies were compared with each other and with the benchmark buyand-hold strategy in terms of achieved levels of risk and return. Sensitivity analysis was used to assess the quality of the estimation on independent subsets. The findings of the study showed that algorithmic strategies outperformed passive strategies in terms of risk-adjusted returns and that for the analyzed indices, Linear Support Vector Machine and Bayesian Generalized Linear Model were the best-performing models. The Linear Support Vector Machine was chosen as the model that, on average, produced the best results using a more thorough rank approach based on the outcomes for all examined models and indices.

Utilizing actual stock prices and correlating factors from the Wind platform presents a potent yet intricate forecasting approach. While previous methodologies have explored this avenue, they encounter challenges including limited comprehension of interrelations among stock data elements, diminished accuracy in extensive series, and struggles with anomaly points. This paper introduces an advanced hybrid model for stock price prediction, termed PMANet. PMANet is founded on Multi-scale Timing Feature Attention, amalgamating Multi-scale Timing Feature Convolution and Ant Particle Swarm Optimization. The model elevates the understanding of dependencies and interrelations within stock data sequences through Probabilistic Positional Attention. Furthermore, the Encoder incorporates Multi-scale Timing Feature Convolution, augmenting the model's capacity to discern multi-scale and significant features while adeptly managing lengthy input sequences. Additionally, the model's proficiency in addressing anomaly points in stock sequences is enhanced by substituting the optimizer with Ant Particle Swarm Optimization. To ascertain the model's efficacy and applicability, we conducted an empirical study using stocks from four pivotal industries in China. The experimental outcomes demonstrate that PMANet is both feasible and versatile in its predictive capability, yielding forecasts closely aligned with actual values, thereby fulfilling application requirements more effectively.

In this paper, we present a deep learning system, which uses a variety of data for a subset of the stocks on the NASDAQ exchange to forecast the stock price. Our framework allows the use of a variational autoencoder (VAE) to remove noise and time-series data engineering to extract higher-level features. A Stacked LSTM Autoencoder is used to perform multi-step-ahead prediction of the stock closing price. This prediction is used by two profit-maximization strategies that include greedy approach and short selling. Besides, we use reinforcement learning as a third profit-enhancement strategy and compare these three strategies to offline strategies that use the actual future prices. Results show that the proposed methods outperform the state-of-the-art time-series forecasting approaches in terms of predictive accuracy and profitability.

J	Wang, ZJ; Zhao, LT				Wang, Zi-Jie; Zhao, Lu-Tao			The impact of the global stock and energy market on EU ETS: A structural equation modelling approach	JOURNAL OF CLEANER PRODUCTION				Article						EU ETS; Carbon price; Structural equation model; Bayesian network		The industrial revolution has brought about great development in the economy, but it has also increased the dependence on fossil energy. The emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases have contradicted economic development and the ecological environment. The establishment of the EU Emission Trading System (EU ETS) has improved the global carbon emission price mechanism, but as a new commodity, its price trend will affect buyers' risk evaluation. Therefore, it is influential to master the driving factors behind carbon emission prices and make effective predictions. First, the paper points out that the driving factors are divided into macroeconomic risk factors and energy factors. Second, the Bayesian Network is used to select variables and make prediction of carbon prices. The results show that its accuracy exceeds other machine learning algorithms. Third, a structural equation model is used to study the impact of the selected markets on the carbon market. Finally, from the perspective of global carbon emission reduction, the relationship between driving factors and the carbon futures market is explained. The empirical results show that Cotation Assistee en Continu 40, natural gas and Brent crude oil will directly affect the yield of European Union Allowances and Certified Emission Reduction futures, and the Standard Poor 500 and Global Clean Energy Index will indirectly affect the yield of European Union Allowances and Certified Emission Reduction futures. The energy market will affect the carbon market through the intermediary effect of the stock market, in which the clean energy index is the most relevant factor. From the perspective of how to improve the carbon trading system, this paper proposes suggestions for the sustainable development of the world to promote the virtuous cycle of the global carbon emission market and the high-quality development of the global economy.

Some countries have committed to net zero carbon emissions, so proper biomass estimations are essential. This study investigates the uses of machine learning (LightGBM, XGBoost), in which hyperparameters were tuned by Bayesian-based Optimisers and a novel Tasmanian Devil Optimisation algorithm for estimates of aboveground biomass (AGB) using Sentinel 1A, Landsat images, and ground survey data. A province in the northern part of Vietnam was selected as a case study since the change in land cover has been considered crucial. The models were optimized/trained and validated using statistical indicators, namely, root mean square error (RMSE), coefficient of determination (R2), and mean absolute error (MAE). The trained models were further explained using SHAP values to understand better how they perform and the contribution of each feature to the overall estimates. The results showed that the three indicators of the proposed model were statistically better than those of the reference methods. Specifically, the hybrid model ended up at RMSE -13.87, MAE - 10.62, and R2 - 0.79 for the estimation of AGB. Based on the experience, such hybrid integration can be recommended as an alternative solution for biomass estimation. In a broader context, the fast growth of machine learning and optimization algorithms has created new scientifically sound solutions for a better analysis of forest cover.

J	Song, XY				Song, Xinyuan			Predicting stock price of construction companies using weighted ensemble learning	HELIYON				Article						Ensemble learning; Forecasting stock price of construction; companies; Artificial Intelligence; Machine Learning		Modeling the behavior of stock price data has always been one of the challenging applications of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) due to its high complexity and dependence on various conditions. Recent studies show that this will be difficult to do with just one learning model. The problem can be more complex for companies in the construction sector, due to the dependency of their behavior on more conditions. This study aims to provide a hybrid model for improving the accuracy of prediction for the stock price index of companies in the construction section. The contribution of this paper can be considered as follows: First, a combination of several prediction models is used to predict stock prices so that learning models can cover each other's errors. In this research, an ensemble model based on Artificial Neural Network (ANN), Gaussian Process Regression (GPR), and Classification and Regression Tree (CART) is presented for predicting the stock price index. Second, the optimization technique is used to determine the effect of each learning model on the prediction result. For this purpose, first, all three mentioned algorithms process the data simultaneously and perform the prediction operation. Then, using the Cuckoo Search (CS) algorithm, the output weight of each algorithm is determined as a coefficient. Finally, using the ensemble technique, these results are combined and the final output is generated through weighted averaging on optimal coefficients. The proposed system was implemented, and its efficiency was evaluated by real stock data of construction companies. The results showed that using CS optimization in the proposed ensemble system is highly effective in reducing prediction error. According to the results, the proposed system can predict the price index with an average accuracy of 96.6 %, which shows a reduction of at least 2.4 % in prediction error compared to the previous methods. Comparing the evaluation results of the proposed system with similar algorithms indicates that our model is more accurate and can be useful for predicting the stock price index in real-world scenarios.

However, due to the volatility and uncertainty of the stock market, forecasting stock indices accurately is challenging. In this paper, a deep nonlinear ensemble framework is proposed for stock index forecasting and uncertainty analysis. (1) Singular spectrum analysis (SSA) is utilized to extract features from a raw stock index and eliminate the interference. (2) Enhanced weighted support vector machine (EWSVM) is proposed for forecasting each component that is decomposed, of which the penalty weights are based on the time order and the hyperparameters are optimized using the simulated annealing algorithm. (3) Recurrent neural network (RNN) is used to integrate the forecast of each component into the final point forecast. (4) Gaussian process regression (GPR) is applied to obtain the interval forecast of the original stock index. Two practical cases (Nikkei 225 Index, Japan and Hang Seng Index, Hong Kong, China) are utilized to evaluate the performance of the proposed model. In terms of the results of point forecasting, the MAE, R-2, MAPE, and RMSE of Nikkei 225 Index are 66.0745, 0.9972, 0.0066, and 80.0381, and those of Hang Seng Index are 79.2145,0.9968, 0.0073, and 96.7740. In terms of the results of interval forecasting, the CP95% , MWP95% , and MC95% of Nikkei 225 Index are 0.89979, 0.05746, and 0.06385, and those of Hang Seng Index are 0.97985, 0.28223, and 0.28803. Forecasting stock indices accurately is crucial for investment decision and risk management and is extremely meaningful to investors and financial regulators. In this paper, the SSA-EWSVM-RNN-GPR model is used to forecast the closing prices of stock indices, and compared with eight benchmark models, the proposed SSA-EWSVM-RNN-GPR model can be an effective tool for both point and interval forecasting of stock indices.

We study a particular kind of reservoir computers called time-delay reservoirs that are constructed out of the sampling of the solution of a time-delay differential equation and show their good performance in the forecasting of the conditional covariances associated to multivariate discrete-time nonlinear stochastic processes of VEC-GARCH type as well as in the prediction of factual daily market realized volatilities computed with intraday quotes, using as training input daily fog-return series of moderate size. We tackle some problems associated to the lack of task-universality for individually operating reservoirs and propose a solution based on the use of parallel arrays of time-delay reservoirs.

Recently, a promising data mining technique in machine learning has been proposed to uncover the predictive relationships of numerous financial and economic variables. Inspired by the fact that the determinant between these variables and their interrelationships over stock returns changes over time, we explore this issue further by using data mining to uncover the recent relevant variables with the greatest predictive ability. The objective is to examine whether using the recent relevant variables leads to additional improvements in stock return forecasting. Given evidence of non-linearity in the financial market, the resulting variables are then provided to neural networks, including probabilistic and feed-forward neural networks, for predicting the directions of future excess stock return. The results show that redeveloped neural network models that use the recent relevant variables generate higher profits with lower risks than the buy-and-hold strategy, conventional linear regression, and the random walk model, as well as the neural network models that use constant relevant variables.

J	Thumu, SR; Nellore, G				Thumu, Subba Reddy; Nellore, Geethanjali			Optimized Ensemble Support Vector Regression Models for Predicting Stock Prices with Multiple Kernels	ACTA INFORMATICA PRAGENSIA				Article						Microsoft corporation (MSFT); Stock forecast; SVR; Hyperbolic tangent kernels (HTK); Linear polynomial RBF kernels (LPR); Ensemble model; Bayesian optimization (BO); Regression metrics		Stock forecasting is a complicated and daily challenge for investors because of the non -linearity of the market and the high volatility of financial assets such as stocks, bonds and other commodities. There is a need for a powerful and adaptive stock prediction model that handles complexities and provides accurate predictions. The support vector regression (SVR) model is one of the most prominent machine learning models for forecasting time series data. An ensemble hyperbolic tangent kernel SVR (HTK-SVR-BO) is proposed in this paper, combining Tanh and inverse Tanh kernels with Bayesian optimization. Combining the strengths of multiple kernels using the ensemble technique and then using optimization to identify the optimal values for each SVR model to enhance the ensemble model performance is possible. Our proposed model is compared with an ensemble SVR model (LPR-SVR-BO), which uses well-known SVR kernel types, including linear, polynomial and radial basis function (RBF). We apply the proposed models to Microsoft Corporation (MSFT) stock prices. The mean absolute error (MAE), mean squared error (MSE), root mean squared error (RMSE), R2 score (model accuracy) and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) are the regression metrics used to compare the effectiveness of each ensemble model. In our comparison, HTK-SVR-BO performs better in terms of regression metrics compared to LPR-SVR-BO and achieves results of 0.27424, 0.13392, 0.36595, 0.99997 and 5.2331 respectively. According to the analysis, the proposed model is more predictive and may generalize to previously unknown data more effectively, so it can be accurate when forecasting future stock prices.

J	Kallus, N				Kallus, Nathan			Treatment Effect Risk: Bounds and Inference	MANAGEMENT SCIENCE				Article						individual treatment effect; conditional average treatment effect; conditional value at risk; partial identification; debiased machine learning	TREATMENT EFFECT HETEROGENEITY; CAUSAL INFERENCE; NONPARAMETRIC-TESTS; OPTIMIZATION; QUANTILE; RATES	Because the average treatment effect (ATE) measures the change in social welfare, even if positive, there is a risk of negative effect on, say, some 10% of the population. Assessing such risk is difficult, however, because any one individual treatment effect (ITE) is never observed, so the 10% worst-affected cannot be identified, whereas distributional treatment effects only compare the first deciles within each treatment group, which does not correspond to any 10% subpopulation. In this paper, we consider how to nonetheless assess this important risk measure, formalized as the conditional value at risk (CVaR) of the ITE distribution. We leverage the availability of pretreatment covariates and characterize the tightest possible upper and lower bounds on ITE-CVaR given by the covariate-conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. We then proceed to study how to estimate these bounds efficiently from data and construct confidence intervals. This is challenging even in randomized experiments as it requires understanding the distribution of the unknown CATE function, which can be very complex if we use rich covariates to best control for heterogeneity. We develop a debiasing method that overcomes this and prove it enjoys favorable statistical properties even when CATE and other nuisances are estimated by black box machine learning or even inconsistently. Studying a hypothetical change to French job search counseling services, our bounds and inference demonstrate a small social benefit entails a negative impact on a substantial subpopulation.

Specifically, we assume that omitted confounders could not change the odds of treatment for any unit by more than a fixed factor. We derive the sharp partial identification bounds implied by this assumption by leveraging distributionally robust optimization, and we propose estimators of these bounds with several novel robustness properties. The first is double sharpness: our estimators consistently estimate the sharp ATE bounds when one of two nuisance parameters is misspecified and achieve semiparametric efficiency when all nuisance parameters are suitably consistent. The second and more novel property is double validity: even when most nuisance parameters are misspecified, our estimators still provide valid but possibly conservative bounds for the ATE and our Wald confidence intervals remain valid even when our estimators are not asymptotically normal. As a result, our estimators provide a highly credible method for sensitivity analysis of causal inferences.

We also apply Bayesian variable selection and nonlinear principal component analysis (NLPCA) for data dimension reduction. With a reduced number of important covariates, we also forecast oil prices (Brent and WTI) with multivariate time series of major S&P 500 stock prices using Gaussian process modeling, deep learning, and vine copula regression. To apply real data to the proposed methods, we select monthly log returns of 2 oil prices and 74 large-cap, major S&P 500 stock prices across the period of February 2001-October 2019. We conclude that vine copula regression with NLPCA is superior overall to other proposed methods in terms of the measures of prediction errors.

In this regard, six months' data cycle trained the data and apply the statistical interference using a ARMA (p, q) model to calculate numerical result. The novelty of this study to find the relation between them either they are strongly correlated or not, using machine learning techniques and ARMA (p, q) process to forecast the behavior KSE 100 index cycles. The adequacy of model describes via least values Akaike information criterion (AIC), Bayesian Schwarz information criterion (SIC) and Hannan Quinn information criterion (HIC). Durbin- Watson (DW) test is also applied. DW values (< 2) shows that all cycles are strongly correlated. Most of the KSE-100 index cycles expresses that the appropriate model is ARMA (2,1). Cycle's 2nd,3rd,4th and 5th shows that ARMA (3,1) is best fitted. Cycle 8th is shows ARMA (1,1) best fit and cycle 12th shows that the most appropriate model is ARMA (4,1). Diagnostic checking tests like Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) and Theil's U-Statistics are used to predict KSE-100 index cycles. Theil's U-Statistics demonstrate that each cycle is strongly correlated to previous one.	[Zaffar, Asma; Hussain, S. M.

Whilst this subject has been covered extensively in finance research, its application to international shipping companies has been limited while the focus has mainly been on the application of traditional linear modelling, using sparse, cross-sectional financial statement data. Insufficient attention has been paid to the noisy and incomplete nature of shipping company financial statement information. This study contributes to the literature through the design, development and testing of a novel holistic machine learning methodology which integrates predictor evaluation and missing data analysis into the distress prediction process. The model was validated using a longitudinal dataset of over 5000 company year-end financial statements combined with macroeconomic and market predictors. We applied this methodology first for individual company level distress prediction before testing the models' ability to provide accurate confidence intervals by backtesting conditional value-at-risk estimations of the distress rates for bank portfolios. We conclude that, by adopting a holistic approach, our methodology can enhance financial monitoring of company loans and bank loan portfolios thereby providing a practical "early warning system" for financial distress.

A central example is the efficient estimating equation for the (local) quantile treatment effect ((L)QTE) in causal inference, which involves the covariate-conditional cumulative distribution function evaluated at the quantile to be estimated. Existing approaches based on flexibly estimating the nuisances and plugging in the estimates, such as debiased machine learning (DML), require we learn the nuisance at all possible inputs. For (L)QTE, DML requires we learn the whole covariate-conditional cumulative distribution function. We instead propose localized debiased machine learning (LDML), which avoids this burdensome step and needs only estimate nuisances at a single initial rough guess for the target parameter. For (L)QTE, LDML involves learning just two regression functions, a standard task for machine learning methods. We prove that under lax rate conditions demonstrate in empirical studies.

Our approach is based on stochastic equations, the Feynman-Dirac path integral, deep Bayesian networks, and temporal generative adversarial neural networks (t-GAN). The expected financial trajectory is evaluated with a Feynman-Dirac path integral. The latter involves summing all possible financial trajectories that could have been taken by the financial instrument. These trajectories are generated with a t-GAN. A probability is attributed to each point of each path. The probability is a function of the Lagrangian, which is derived from a stochastic equation describing the temporal evolution of the stock. The drift and the volatility at each point, which are required in order to evaluate the Lagrangian, are predicted with a deep Bayesian neural network. Given that the evolution of a stock's price is isomorphic to a time series, our temporal GAN consists of long short-term memory (LSTM) neural networks, which introduce a memory mechanism, and temporal convolutional neural networks (TCN), which ensure causality. Stock prices are predicted over periods of twenty and thirty days for nine stocks, eight of which are included in the S&P 500 index. Our experimental results clearly demonstrate the efficiency of our approach.

However, given the apparent volatility and chaotic nature of the non-ferrous metal price sequence, forecasting it remains a difficult challenge. While prior research employed a variety of methodologies to forecast metal prices, they overlooked the critical role of chaos feature analysis and the necessity of error analysis, severely limiting prediction accuracy. This paper designs a novel non-ferrous metal price ensemble prediction system that incorporates data decomposition, phase space reconstruction, multi-objective optimization, point prediction, and interval prediction. A combined kernel extreme learning machine based on the improved multi-objective lion swarm optimization algorithm is developed and theoretically explained to improve prediction accuracy and reliability. Additionally, the appropriate creation of the prediction interval based on the best-fit distribution of the point prediction error enabled the examination of various levels of uncertainty. In an empirical experiment using copper and aluminum prices from the London Metal Exchange, the proposed system demonstrated benefits in point and interval prediction, providing decision makers with useful prediction references.

In these models, stock price volatility and trading volume are jointly directed by the unobservable number of price-relevant information arrivals, which is specified as a serially correlated random variable. It is shown that the efficient importance sampling technique is extremely accurate and that it produces results that differ significantly from those reported by Watanabe.

Probabilistic forecasting of the solar irradiance with recursive ARMA and GARCH models	SOLAR ENERGY				Article						Probabilistic solar forecasts; Clear sky index; ARMA; GARCH; Operational framework; Recursive least square	RELIABILITY DIAGRAMS; POWER-GENERATION; STORAGE-SYSTEM; RADIATION; WIND; PREDICTION; ENSEMBLE; BENCHMARKING; GRIDS; US	Forecasting of the solar irradiance is a key feature in order to increase the penetration rate of solar energy into the energy grids. Indeed, the anticipation of the fluctuations of the solar renewables allows a better management of the production means of electricity and a better operation of the grid-connected storage systems. If numerous methods for forecasting the mean of the solar irradiance were recently developed, there are only few works dedicated to the evaluation of prediction intervals associated to these point forecasts. Time series of solar irradiance and more specifically of clear sky index show some similarities with that of financial time series. The aim of this paper is to assess the performances of a commonly used combination of two linear models (ARMA and GARCH) in econometrics in order to provide probabilistic forecasts of solar irradiance. In addition, a recursive estimation of the parameters of the models has been set up in order to provide a framework that can be applied easily in an operational context. A comprehensive testing procedure has been used to assess both point forecasts and probabilistic forecasts. Using only the past records of the solar irradiance, the proposed model is able to perform point forecasts as accurately as other methods based on machine learning techniques. Moreover, the recursive ARMA GARCH model is easier to set-up and it gives additional information about the uncertainty of the forecasts. Even if some strong assumption has been made regarding the statistical distribution of the error, the reliability of the probabilistic forecasts stands in the same order of magnitude as other works done in the field of solar forecasting.

The primary purpose of this paper is to determine the amount of investment in each of the shares of the listed company and the time of purchase, holding or sale of shares to maximize total return and reduce investment risk. Design/methodology/approach - To achieve the goals of the problem, a two-level combined intelligent method, such as a support vector machine, decision tree, network Bayesian, k-nearest neighbors and multilayer perceptron neural network as heterogeneous basic models of ensemble learning in the first level, was applied. Then, the majority vote method (weighted average) in the second stage as the final model of learning was collectively used. Therefore, the data collected from 208 listed companies active in the Tehran stock exchange () from 2011 to 2015 have been used to teach the data. For testing and analysis, the data of the same companies between 2016 and 2020 have been used. Findings - The results showed that the method of combined ensemble learning and genetics has the highest total stock portfolio yield of 114.12%, with a risk of 0.905%. Also, by examining the rate of return on capital, it was observed that the proposed method has the highest average rate of return on investment of 110.64%. As a result, the proposed method leads to higher returns with lower risk than the purchase and maintenance method for fund managers and companies and predicts market trends. Research limitations/implications - In the forthcoming research, there were no limitations to obtain research data were easily extracted from the site of Tehran Stock Exchange Technology Management Company and Rahvard Novin software, and simulation was performed in MATLAB software. Practical implications - In this paper, using combined machine learning methods, companies' stock prices are predicted and stock portfolio optimization is optimized. As companies and private organizations are trying to increase their rate of return, so they need a way to predict stock prices based on specific indicators. It turned out that this algorithm has the highest stock portfolio return with reasonable investment risk, and therefore, investors, portfolio managers and market timers can be used this method to optimize the stock portfolio. Social implications - The homogeneous and heterogeneous two-level hybrid model presented in the research can be used to predict market trends by market timers and fund managers. Also, adjusting the portfolio with this method has a much higher return than the return on buying and holding, and with controlled risk, it increases the security of investors' capital, and investors invest their capital in the funds more safely. And will achieve their expected returns. As a result, the psychological security gained from using this method for portfolio arrangement will eventually lead to the growth of the capital market. Originality/value - This paper tries to present the best combination of stock portfolios of active companies of the Tehran Stock Exchange by using the two-level combined intelligent method and genetic algorithm.

Predicting economic growth with stock networks	PHYSICA A-STATISTICAL MECHANICS AND ITS APPLICATIONS				Article						Econophysics; Stock networks; Naive Bayes classifier; Machine learning; Economic growth	MARKET; RECESSIONS; CENTRALITY; SELECTION; PRICE; POWER	Networks derived from stock prices are often used to model developments on financial markets and are tightly intertwined with crises. Yet, the influence of changing market topologies on the broader economy (i.e. GDP) is unclear. In this paper, we propose a Bayesian approach that utilizes individual-level network measures of companies as lagged probabilistic features to predict national economic growth. We use a comprehensive data set consisting of Standard and Poor's 500 corporations from January 1988 until October 2016. The final model forecasts correctly all major recession and prosperity phases of the U.S. economy up to one year ahead. By employing different network measures on the level of corporations, we can also identify which companies' stocks possess a key role in a changing economic environment and may be used as indication of critical (and prosperous) developments. More generally, the proposed approach allows to predict probabilities for different overall states of social entities by using local network positions and could be applied on various phenomena.

J	Dixon, M				Dixon, Matthew			Industrial Forecasting with Exponentially Smoothed Recurrent Neural Networks	TECHNOMETRICS				Article						Exponential smoothing; Forecasting; Nonstationarity; Partial autocorrelations; Quantification; Uncertainty		Time series modeling has entered an era of unprecedented growth in the size and complexity of data which require new modeling approaches. While many new general purpose machine learning approaches have emerged, they remain poorly understand and irreconcilable with more traditional statistical modeling approaches. We present a general class of exponential smoothed recurrent neural networks (RNNs) which are well suited to modeling nonstationary dynamical systems arising in industrial applications. In particular, we analyze their capacity to characterize the nonlinear partial autocorrelation structure of time series and directly capture dynamic effects such as seasonality and trends. Application of exponentially smoothed RNNs to forecasting electricity load, weather data, and stock prices highlight the efficacy of exponential smoothing of the hidden state for multistep time series forecasting. The results also suggest that popular, but more complicated neural network architectures originally designed for speech processing are likely over-engineered for industrial forecasting and light-weight exponentially smoothed architectures, trained in a fraction of the time, capture the salient features while being superior and more robust than simple RNNs and autoregressive models. Additionally, uncertainty quantification of Bayesian exponential smoothed RNNs is shown to provide improved coverage.

The aim of this study is to validate this hypothesis. This study uses artificial intelligence models designed to predict IBEX trends, based on investor mood, extracting information from the big data and using natural language processing algorithms. The results of the study show that the success rate of a system that trains for only 6 months is higher than a system that uses all the available historical information. Investment strategies can also be based on the forecasts of the artificial intelligence models, which can beat the market, by setting up different trading systems for different degrees of risk, depending on the probability threshold provided by the model considered. These results imply that the Spanish financial market has a short-term memory, and does not include older information and therefore does not fulfill the efficient market hypothesis assumptions.

Portfolio optimization is a process of modulating asset distributions to maximize expected returns and minimize risks. Despite numerous studies on shallow learning models, they have shown limited success in analyzing the complex nature of massive stock data, a task where recent deep learning models excel. However, the deterministic nature of conventional deep learning models impedes their consideration of portfolio risk due to an inherent lack of uncertainty quantification in their predictions. This paper proposes a novel portfolio weighting strategy, incorporating both risk and return considerations within a deep learning framework. We propose the Predictive Auxiliary Classifier Generative Adversarial Networks (PredACGAN), a probabilistic deep learning model, to measure prediction uncertainty. The PredACGAN generator leverages latent vectors and historical stock prices to predict future returns. The model synthesizes predictive distributions from various latent vectors and past prices. The associated risk is produced via the entropy of these distributions, facilitating portfolio optimization through both return and risk considerations. The proposed algorithm removes high-risk assets from the investment universe at rebalancing moments, enabling PredACGAN to optimize portfolios considering both return and risk. We evaluated PredACGAN and the accompanying algorithm with S & P 500 stocks from 1990 to 2020, with portfolios rebalanced monthly based on PredACGAN predictions and risk measures. The PredACGAN portfolios yielded 9.123% annual returns and a 1.054 Sharpe ratio, outperforming a risk-agnostic portfolio yielding 1.024% annual returns and a 0.236 Sharpe ratio. The PredACGAN portfolio also exhibited lower maximum drawdowns, highlighting its effectiveness.

First, we select features to represent the surface and predict them. Second, we use the predicted features to construct the IVS using a deep neural network (DNN) model by incorporating constraints that can prevent static arbitrage. We consider three methods to extract features from the implied volatility data: principal component analysis, variational autoencoder, and sampling the surface. We predict these features using the long short-term memory model. Additionally, we use a long time series of implied volatility data for S&P500 index options to train our models. We find that two feature construction methods (i.e. sampling the surface and variational autoencoders combined with DNN for surface construction) are the best performers in the out-of-sample prediction. Furthermore, both of them substantially outperform a popular regression model. We also find that the DNN model for surface construction not only removes static arbitrage but also significantly reduces the prediction error compared with a standard interpolation method.

As the world economy is becoming more complex and standard modelling assumptions are violated, the advanced artificial intelligence solutions may provide the right tools to analyse the global market. In this paper, we provide a novel approach for measuring market risk called Encoded Value-at-Risk (Encoded VaR), which is based on a type of artificial neural network, called Variational Auto-encoders (VAEs). Encoded VaR is a generative model which can be used to reproduce market scenarios from a range of historical cross-sectional stock returns, while increasing the signal-to-noise ratio present in the financial data, and learning the dependency structure of the market without any assumptions about the joint distribution of stock returns. We compare Encoded VaR out-of-sample results with twelve other methods and show that it is competitive to many other well-known VaR algorithms presented in the literature.

We survey the literature in order to discover whether the proposed methods provide superior forecasts compared to traditional econometric models, how widespread the application of explainable AI is, and to outline potential areas for further research. Generally, we find the efficacy of AI and ML methods for volatility prediction to be highly promising, often providing comparative or better results than their econometric counterparts. Neural networks employing memory, such as Long-Short Term Memory and Gated Recurrent Units, consistently rank among the top performing models. However, traditional econometric models are still highly relevant, commonly yielding similar results as more advanced ML and AI models. In light of the success with ensemble methods, a promising area of research is the use of hybrid models, combining machine learning and econometric models. In spite of the common critique of many machine learning models being of a black -box nature, we find that very few papers apply XAI to analyze and support their empirical results. Thus, we recommend that researchers strive harder to employ XAI in future work. Similarly, we see potential for applications of probabilistic machine learning, effectively quantifying uncertainty in volatility forecasts from machine learning models.

The first and best-known cryptocurrency example is bitcoin. Cryptocurrencies are used to make transactions anonymously and securely over the internet. The decentralization behavior of a cryptocurrency has radically reduced central control over them, thereby influencing international trade and relations. Wide fluctuations in cryptocurrency prices motivate the urgent requirement for an accurate model to predict its price. Cryptocurrency price prediction is one of the trending areas among researchers. Research work in this field uses traditional statistical and machine-learning techniques, such as Bayesian regression, logistic regression, linear regression, support vector machine, artificial neural network, deep learning, and reinforcement learning. No seasonal effects exist in cryptocurrency, making it hard to predict using a statistical approach. Traditional statistical methods, although simple to implement and interpret, require a lot of statistical assumptions that could be unrealistic, leaving machine learning as the best technology in this field, being capable of predicting price based on experience. This article provides a comprehensive summary of the previous studies in the field of cryptocurrency price prediction from 2010 to 2020. The discussion presented in this article will help researchers to fill the gap in existing studies and gain more future insight.

This paper presents data-driven machine learning techniques for pricing such capped volatility swaps, using unique data sets comprising both the strike price of contracts at initiation and the daily observed prices of running contracts. Additionally, the developed model can serve as a validation tool for external volatility swap prices, flagging prices that deviate significantly from the estimated value. In order to predict the capped, future, realized volatility, we explore distributional information on the underlying asset, specifically by extracting information from the implied volatilities and market-implied moments of the asset. The pricing performance of tree-based machine learning techniques and a Gaussian process regression model is evaluated in a validation setting tailored to the use of financial data.

In this study, we propose a multivariate financial time-series forecasting method. Our model addresses the long- and short-term features, multimodal and non-stationarity nature of multivariate time-series by incorporating the improved deep neural networks and certified noise injection. Specifically, multimodal variational autoencoder is used to extract deep high-level features of multivariate time-series, Long- and Short- Term recurrent neural network is applied for multivariate time-series forecasting, and certified noise injection mechanism, inspired by differential privacy, is proposed to improve the robustness and accuracy of prediction. Extensive empirical results on real-world agricultural commodity futures price time series and relevant external data demonstrate that our model achieves better performance over that of several state-of-the-art baseline methods.

Performance evaluations of these distinct forecasting methodologies are conducted using an appropriate loss function. Results indicate that the GARCH model with a normal distribution consistently outperforms other models, particularly when forecasting VaR. Conversely, the DeepAR model exhibits limited effectiveness in VaR forecasting across all scenarios, except for liquidity pools involving at least one stablecoin. However, it demonstrates greater reliability in predicting most ES risk measures and associated data. Our findings underscore that in a subset of the data, providing liquidity to pairs involving at least one stablecoin entails statistically significant lower risk compared to holding an equivalent amount of crypto assets. Furthermore, this research contributes to the advancement of novel risk management tools and strategies tailored for liquidity providers.

J	Amelot, LMM; Agathee, US; Sunecher, Y				Amelot, Lydie Myriam Marcelle; Subadar Agathee, Ushad; Sunecher, Yuvraj			Time series modelling, NARX neural network and hybrid KPCA-SVR approach to forecast the foreign exchange market in Mauritius	AFRICAN JOURNAL OF ECONOMIC AND MANAGEMENT STUDIES				Article						Forex market; Time series model; Artificial intelligence; ARIMA; GARCH; ANN; NARX; KPCA-SVR	PRINCIPAL COMPONENT ANALYSIS; RATES	Purpose This study constructs time series model, artificial neural networks (ANNs) and statistical topologies to examine the volatility and forecast foreign exchange rates. The Mauritian forex market has been utilized as a case study, and daily data for nominal spot rate (during a time period of five years spanning from 2014 to 2018) for EUR/MUR, GBP/MUR, CAD/MUR and AUD/MUR have been applied for the predictions. Design/methodology/approach Autoregressive integrated moving average (ARIMA) and generalized autoregressive conditional heteroskedasticity (GARCH) models are used as a basis for time series modelling for the analysis, along with the non-linear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) neural network backpropagation algorithm utilizing different training functions, namely, Levenberg-Marquardt (LM), Bayesian regularization and scaled conjugate gradient (SCG) algorithms. The study also features a hybrid kernel principal component analysis (KPCA) using the support vector regression (SVR) algorithm as an additional statistical tool to conduct financial market forecasting modelling. Mean squared error (MSE) and root mean square error (RMSE) are employed as indicators for the performance of the models. Findings The results demonstrated that the GARCH model performed better in terms of volatility clustering and prediction compared to the ARIMA model. On the other hand, the NARX model indicated that LM and Bayesian regularization training algorithms are the most appropriate method of forecasting the different currency exchange rates as the MSE and RMSE seemed to be the lowest error compared to the other training functions. Meanwhile, the results reported that NARX and KPCA-SVR topologies outperformed the linear time series models due to the theory based on the structural risk minimization principle. Finally, the comparison between the NARX model and KPCA-SVR illustrated that the NARX model outperformed the statistical prediction model. Overall, the study deduced that the NARX topology achieves better prediction performance results compared to time series and statistical parameters. Research limitations/implications The foreign exchange market is considered to be instable owing to uncertainties in the economic environment of any country and thus, accurate forecasting of foreign exchange rates is crucial for any foreign exchange activity. The study has an important economic implication as it will help researchers, investors, traders, speculators and financial analysts, users of financial news in banking and financial institutions, money changers, non-banking financial companies and stock exchange institutions in Mauritius to take investment decisions in terms of international portfolios. Moreover, currency rates instability might raise transaction costs and diminish the returns in terms of international trade. Exchange rate volatility raises the need to implement a highly organized risk management measures so as to disclose future trend and movement of the foreign currencies which could act as an essential guidance for foreign exchange participants. By this way, they will be more alert before conducting any forex transactions including hedging, asset pricing or any speculation activity, take corrective actions, thus preventing them from making any potential losses in the future and gain more profit. Originality/value This is one of the first studies applying artificial intelligence (AI) while making use of time series modelling, the NARX neural network backpropagation algorithm and hybrid KPCA-SVR to predict forex using multiple currencies in the foreign exchange market in Mauritius.

More specifically, we characterize the cutting tool dynamics using a delay differential equation (DDE) and enlist the temporal finite element method (TFEM) to derive its approximate solution and stability index given process settings or design variables. To further quantify the inherent uncertainty, replications of TFEM under different realizations of random uncontrollable variables are performed, which however incurs extra computational burden. To eschew the deployment of such a crude Monte Carlo (MC) approach at each design setting, we integrate the stochastic TFEM with a stochastic surrogate model, stochastic kriging, in an active learning framework to sequentially approximate the stability boundary. The numerical result suggests that the nominal stability boundary attained from this method is on par with that from the crude MC, but only demands a fraction of the computational overhead. To further ensure the robustness of process stability, we adopt another surrogate, the Gaussian process, to predict the variance of the stability index at unexplored design points and identify the robust stability boundary per the conditional value at risk (CVaR) criterion. Therefrom, an optimal design in the robust stable region that maximizes the MRR can be identified.

However short-term trades may entail high profits if traders open and close the correct positions. The high volatility of cryptocurrencies, and in particular of Bitcoin, is what made cryptocurrency trading so profitable in these last years. The main goal of this work is to compare several frameworks each other to predict the daily closing Bitcoin price, investigating those that provide the best performance, after a rigorous model selection by the so-called k-fold cross validation method. We evaluated the performance of one stage frameworks, based only on one machine learning technique, such as the Bayesian Neural Network, the Feed Forward and the Long Short Term Memory Neural Networks, and that of two stages frameworks formed by the neural networks just mentioned in cascade to Support Vector Regression. Results highlight higher performance of the two stages frameworks with respect to the correspondent one stage frameworks, but for the Bayesian Neural Network. The one stage framework based on Bayesian Neural Network has the highest performance and the order of magnitude of the mean absolute percentage error computed on the predicted price by this framework is in agreement with those reported in recent literature works.

In this paper, we leverage probabilistic deep learning for inferring the volatility index VIX. We employ the probabilistic counterpart of WaveNet, Temporal Convolutional Network (TCN), and Transformers. We show that TCN outperforms all models with an RMSE around 0.189. In addition, it has been well known that modern neural networks provide inaccurate uncertainty estimates. For solving this problem, we use the standard deviation scaling to calibrate the networks. Furthermore, we found out that MNF with Gaussian prior outperforms Reparameterization Trick and Flipout models in terms of precision and uncertainty predictions. Finally, we claim that MNF with Cauchy and LogUniform prior distributions yield well-calibrated TCN, and Transformer and WaveNet networks being the former that best infer the VIX values for one and five-step-ahead forecasting, and the probabilistic Transformer model yields an adequate forecasting for the COVID-19 pandemic period.

Recently, machine learning models have elicited considerable attention from researchers because of their improved prediction accuracy in pricing financial derivatives. We propose a generative Bayesian learning model that incorporates a prior reflecting a risk-neutral pricing structure to provide fair prices for the deep ITM and the deep OTM options that are rarely traded. We conduct a comprehensive empirical study to compare classical financial option models with machine learning models in terms of model estimation and prediction using S&P 100 American put options from 2003 to 2012. Results indicate that machine learning models demonstrate better prediction performance than the classical financial option models. Especially, we observe that the generative Bayesian neural network model demonstrates the best overall prediction performance.

J	Lahmiri, S; Bekiros, S				Lahmiri, Salim; Bekiros, Stelios			Intelligent forecasting with machine learning trading systems in chaotic intraday Bitcoin market	CHAOS SOLITONS & FRACTALS				Article						Machine learning; Intraday trading; Bitcoin; Forecasting; 90.01 Social Phenomena	CRYPTOCURRENCIES; COMPLEXITY	Due to the remarkable boost in cryptocurrency trading on digital blockchain platforms, the utilization of advanced machine learning systems for robust prediction of highly nonlinear and noisy data, gains further popularity by individual and institutional market agents. The purpose of our study is to comparatively evaluate a plethora of Artificial Intelligence systems in forecasting high frequency Bitcoin price series. We employ three different sets of models, i.e., statistical machine learning approaches including support vector regressions (SVR) and Gaussian Poisson regressions (GRP), algorithmic models such as regression trees (RT) and the k-nearest neighbours (kNN) and finally artificial neural network topologies such as feedforward (FFNN), Bayesian regularization (BRNN) and radial basis function networks (RBFNN). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time an extensive empirical investigation of the comparative predictability of various machine learning models is implemented in high-frequency trading of Bitcoin. The entropy analysis of training and testing samples reveals long memory traits, high levels of stochasticity, and topological complexity. The presence of inherent nonlinear dynamics of Bitcoin time series fully rationalizes the use of advanced machines learning techniques. The optimal parameter values for SVR, GRP and kNN are found via Bayesian optimization. Based on diverse performance metrics, our results show that the BRNN renders an outstanding accuracy in forecasting, while its convergence is unhindered and remarkably fast.

This paper presents a tri-state labeling approach to classify the underlying patterns in price data into up, down and no-action classes. The introduction of a no-action state in our novel approach alleviates the burden of denoising the dataset as a preprocessing task. The performance of our labeling algorithm is experimented with using machine learning and deep learning models. The framework is augmented by applying the Bayesian optimization technique for the selection of the best tuning values of the hyperparameters. The price trend prediction module generates the required trading signals. The results show that the average annualized Sharpe ratio as the trading performance metric is about 2.823, indicating the framework produces excellent cumulative returns.

In the respective nested simulation framework, the goal is to estimate portfolio tail risk, quantified via value-at-risk (VaR) or tail value-at-risk (TVaR), of portfolio losses in a given collection of future economic scenarios represented by factor levels at the risk horizon. Traditionally, evaluating portfolio losses in an outer scenario is done by computing a conditional expectation via inner-level Monte Carlo simulations and is computationally expensive. We introduce several inter-related machine learning techniques to speed up this computation, in particular by properly accounting for the simulation noise. Our main workhorse is an advanced Gaussian process (GP) regression approach that uses nonparametric spatial modeling to efficiently learn the relationship between the stochastic factors defining scenarios and corresponding portfolio values. Leveraging this emulator, we develop sequential algorithms that adaptively allocate inner simulation budgets to target the quantile region. The GP framework also yields better uncertainty quantification for the resulting VaR/TVaR estimators which reduce bias and variance compared to existing methods. We illustrate the proposed strategies with two case-studies in two and six dimensions.

We use Conditional Value at Risk (CVaR) to measure the probability of constraint violation and safety. In order to provide a safe policy by construction, we first propose using parameterized nonlinear DRMPC at each time step. DRMPC optimizes a finite-horizon cost function subject to the worst-case constraint violation in an ambiguity set. We use a statistical ball around the empirical distribution with a radius measured by the Wasserstein metric as the ambiguity set. Unlike the sample average approximation SMPC, DRMPC provides a probabilistic guarantee of the out-of-sample risk and requires lower samples from the disturbance. Then the Q-learning method is used to optimize the parameters in the DRMPC to achieve the best closed-loop performance. Wheeled Mobile Robot (WMR) path planning with obstacle avoidance will be considered to illustrate the efficiency of the proposed method.

However, when dealing with a large number of predictors, these methods may overfit the data and provide poor out-of-sample forecasts. Our paper addresses this issue by employing two different approaches to predict realized volatility. On the one hand, we use a two-step procedure where several dimensionality reduction methods, such as Bayesian Model Averaging (BMA), Principal Component Analysis (PCA), and Least Absolute Shrinkage and Selection Operator (Lasso), are employed in the initial step to reduce dimensionality. The reduced samples are then combined with artificial neutral networks. On the other hand, we implement two single-step regularized neural networks that can shrink the input weights to zero and effectively handle high-dimensional data. Our findings on the volatility of different stock asset prices indicate that the reduced models outperform the compared models without regularization in terms of predictive accuracy.

We illustrate that for many classical problems, we can arrive at speed-ups of several orders of magnitude by deploying machine learning techniques based on Gaussian process regression. The price we have to pay for this extra speed is some loss of accuracy. However, we show that this reduced accuracy is often well within reasonable limits and hence very acceptable from a practical point of view. The concrete examples concern fitting and estimation. In the fitting context, we fit sophisticated Greek profiles and summarize implied volatility surfaces. In the estimation context, we reduce computation times for the calculation of vanilla option values under advanced models, the pricing of American options and the pricing of exotic options under models beyond the Black-Scholes setting.

To this end, a large variety of machine learning algorithms have been examined. However, it is now widely understood that, in real-world trading settings, no single machine learning model can consistently outperform the alternatives. In this work, we examine the efficacy and the feasibility of developing a stacked generalization system, intelligently combining the predictions of diverse machine learning models. Our approach establishes a novel inferential framework that comprises the following levels of data processing: (i) We model the dependence patterns between major currency pairs via a diverse set of commonly used machine learning algorithms, namely support vector machines (SVMs), random forests (RFs), Bayesian autoregressive trees (BART), dense-layer neural networks (NNs), and naive Bayes (NB) classifiers. (ii) We generate implied signals of exchange rate fluctuation, based on the output of these models, as well as appropriate side information obtained by analyzing the correlations across currency pairs in our training datasets. (iii) We finally combine these implied signals into an aggregate predictive waveforth, by leveraging majority voting, genetic algorithm optimization, and regression weighting techniques. We thoroughly test our framework in real-world trading scenarios; we show that our system leads to significantly better trading performance than the considered benchmarks. Thus, it represents an attractive solution for financial firms and corporations that perform foreign exchange portfolio management and daily trading. Our system can be used as an integrated part in international commercial trade activities or in a quantitative investing framework for algorithmic trading and carry-trade speculation.

Practical Bayesian support vector regression for financial time series prediction and market condition change detection	QUANTITATIVE FINANCE				Article						Support vector machines regression; Kernel scaling; Machine learning; Bayesian inference; Multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization; Gaussian process; C44; C45; C61	LIBRARY	Support vector regression (SVR) has long been proven to be a successful tool to predict financial time series. The core idea of this study is to outline an automated framework for achieving a faster and easier parameter selection process, and at the same time, generating useful prediction uncertainty estimates in order to effectively tackle flexible real-world financial time series prediction problems. A Bayesian approach to SVR is discussed, and implemented. It is found that the direct implementation of the probabilistic framework of Gao et al. returns unsatisfactory results in our experiments. A novel enhancement is proposed by adding a new kernel scaling parameter mu to overcome the difficulties encountered. In addition, the multi-armed bandit Bayesian optimization technique is applied to automate the parameter selection process. Our framework is then tested on financial time series of various asset classes (i.e. equity index, credit default swaps spread, bond yields, and commodity futures) to ensure its flexibility. It is shown that the generalization performance of this parameter selection process can reach or sometimes surpass the computationally expensive cross-validation procedure. An adaptive calibration process is also described to allow practical use of the prediction uncertainty estimates to assess the quality of predictions. It is shown that the machine-learning approach discussed in this study can be developed as a very useful pricing tool, and potentially a market condition change detector. A further extension is possible by taking the prediction uncertainties into consideration when building a financial portfolio.

In previous work, generative adversarial net-works (GANs) were employed to demonstrate the generation of plausible correlationmatrixes that capture the essential characteristics observed in empirical correlationmatrixes estimated on asset returns. Instead of GANs, we employ variational autoen-coders (VAEs) to achieve a more interpretable latent space representation and toobtain a generator of plausible correlation matrixes by sampling the VAE's latentspace. Through our analysis, we reveal that the VAE's latent space can be a use-ful tool to capture the crucial factors impacting portfolio diversification, particularlyin relation to the sensitivity of credit portfolios to changes in asset correlations. AVAE trained on the historical time series of correlation matrixes is used to generatesynthetic correlation matrixes that satisfy a set of expected financial properties. Our analysis provides clear indications that the capacity for realistic data augmentationprovided by VAEs, combined with the ability to obtain model interpretability, canprove useful for risk management, enhancing the resilience and accuracy of modelswhen backtesting, as past data may exhibit biases and might not contain the essentialhigh-stress events required for evaluating diverse risk scenarios.

This research is driven by the central goal of introducing a specialized deep learning model tailored to predict digital currency prices, with a specific emphasis on BTC. To address this challenge, a pioneering strategy has been established, leveraging probabilistic gated recurrent units (P-GRU). This approach integrates probabilistic attributes into the model, facilitating the generation of probability distributions for projected values. The effectiveness of this method is assessed using one year of BTC price history, sampled at a five-minute interval. In parallel, a comparative analysis is conducted against alternative models, including GRU, long short-term memory (LSTM), and variants thereof (time-distributed, bidirectional, and simple models). In pursuit of optimizing model efficacy, a bespoke callback mechanism is deployed. This callback, driven by R2-score tracking, captures optimal model weights based on validation data. Moreover, a transfer learning paradigm is adopted to broaden the study's horizons. A pre-trained model on BTC data is harnessed to predict prices for six other prominent cryptocurrencies: Ethereum, Litecoin, Tron, Polkadot, Cardano, and Stellar. Consequently, a distinct model is tailored for each cryptocurrency. The outcomes of this investigation conclusively underscore the superior performance of the proposed methodology. In the midst of a volatile and uncertain market landscape, the proposed approach outshines its counterparts, showcasing an enhanced ability for cryptocurrency price forecasting.

The proposed approach, denominated "Commitment Machine" (CM), has a strong focus on assets cross-correlation and allows to measure adaptively the ES, dynamically evaluating which is the most performing method through the minimization of a loss function. The CM algorithm compares four different ES estimation techniques which all take into account the interaction effects among assets: a Bayesian Vector autoregressive model, Stochastic Differential Equation (SDE) numerical schemes with Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA), a Generalized AutoRegressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity (GARCH) volatility model and a hybrid method that integrates Dynamic Recurrent Neural Networks together with a Monte Carlo approach. The integration of traditional Monte Carlo approaches with Machine Learning technologies and the heterogeneity of dynamically selected methodologies lead to an improved estimation of the ES. The study describes the techniques adopted by the CM and the logic behind model selection; moreover, it provides a market application case of the proposed metaheuristic, by simulating an equally weighted multi-asset portfolio.

In modern electronically driven markets, traditional time-series econometric methods often appear incapable of capturing the true complexity of the multilevel interactions driving the price dynamics. While recent research has established the effectiveness of traditional machine learning (ML) models in financial applications, their intrinsic inability to deal with uncertainties, which is a great concern in econometrics research and real business applications, constitutes a major drawback. Bayesian methods naturally appear as a suitable remedy conveying the predictive ability of ML methods with the probabilistically oriented practice of econometric research. By adopting a state-of-the-art second-order optimization algorithm, we train a Bayesian bilinear neural network with temporal attention, suitable for the challenging time-series task of predicting mid-price movements in ultra-high-frequency limit-order book markets. We thoroughly compare our Bayesian model with traditional ML alternatives by addressing the use of predictive distributions to analyze errors and uncertainties associated with the estimated parameters and model forecasts. Our results underline the feasibility of the Bayesian deep-learning approach and its predictive and decisional advantages in complex econometric tasks, prompting future research in this direction.

For this problem, from the perspective of machine learning, we study the dynamic forecasting and liquidity assessment of financial markets, based on econophysics and Bayesian methods. We establish eight dynamic prediction methods, based on our proposed likelihood estimation and Bayesian estimation methods of macro and micro evolution models of econophysics. Combined machine learning thinking and real data, we empirically study and simulate the out-of-sample dynamic forecasting analysis of eight proposed methods and compare with the benchmark GARCH model. A variety of loss functions, superior predictive ability test (SPA), Akaike and Bayesian information criterion (AIC and BIC) methods are introduced to further evaluate the forecasting performance of our proposed methods. The research of out of sample prediction shows that (1) the method of the simplified stochastic model with Bayesian method for only sample return has the best forecasting performance; (2) the method of the stochastic model with Bayesian method for only return samples has the worst forecasting performance. For the liquidity assessment problem, there is a strong correlation between the trading probability evaluated by the proposed eight methods and the real turnover rate, and an increase of liquidity is correspond to the increase of asset risk. In other words, it suggests that all proposed methods can well evaluate market liquidity. (C) 2021 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved.

In modern time series analysis, sequential pattern mining (SPM) and association discovery (AD) are the most important techniques to predict the future trends. This study aims at developing advanced SPM and AD for financial data by cutting edge techniques from artificial intelligence and machine learning. The nonlinearity and non-stationarity of financial time series dynamics pose a major challenge for SPM and AD. This study employs time-frequency analysis to extract features for SPM. Then, a sparse multi-manifold clustering (SMMC) is used to partition the feature space into several disjointed regions for better AD. Finally, local relevance vector machines (RVMs) are employed for AD and perform the forecasting. Different from traditional methods, the novel forecasting system operates on multiple resolutions and multiple dynamic regimes. SMMC finds both the neighbors and the weights automatically by a sparse solution, which approximately spans a low-dimensional affine subspace at that point. RVM, the Bayesian kernel machines, can produce parsimonious models with excellent generalization properties. Taking multiple time series data from financial markets as an example, the empirical results demonstrate that the proposed model outperforms traditional models and significantly reduces the forecasting errors. The framework is effective and suitable for other time series forecasting.

A general Bayesian model for heteroskedastic data with fully conjugate full-conditional distributions	JOURNAL OF STATISTICAL COMPUTATION AND SIMULATION				Article						Deep learning; echo state network; Gibbs sampling; mixed models; multivariate log-Gamma; spatial; volatility	STOCHASTIC VOLATILITY; INFORMATION CRITERION; REGRESSION; INFERENCE; VARIANCE; NETWORK; GARCH	Models for heteroskedastic data are relevant in a variety of applications ranging from financial time series to environmental statistics. However, the topic of modelling the variance function conditionally has not seen as much attention as modelling the mean. Volatility models have been used in specific applications, but these models can be difficult to fit in a Bayesian setting due to posterior distributions that are challenging to sample efficiently. In this work, we introduce a general model for heteroskedastic data. This approach models the conditional variance as a function of any desired covariates or random effects. We rely on multivariate log-Gamma distribution theory to construct priors that yield fully conjugate full-conditional distributions for Gibbs sampling. Furthermore, we extend the model to a deep learning approach that can provide highly accurate estimates for time dependent data. We also provide an extension for heavy-tailed data. We illustrate our methodology via three applications.

Hence, it is essential to forecast the prices of fossil energy commodities. In this study, various machine learning systems are optimized by using Bayesian optimization method and implemented to forecast prices in 12 different fossil energy markets including crude oil, natural gas, propane, kerosene, gasoline, heating oil, and coal based on price information from all fossil energy markets. The optimized machine learning systems considered in modeling and simulations are Gaussian regression process, support vector regression, regression trees, k -nearest neighbor algorithm, and deep feedforward neural networks. The simulation results show that Gaussian regression process is the best system to forecast fossil energy markets. In addition, the deep learning feedforward neural networks system yields to stable forecasts. Furthermore, the prediction of the prices in natural gas, coal, and propane markets is a difficult task compared to the prediction of the prices in crude oil markets. The understanding of the effectiveness of machine learning systems in pricing different fossil energy markets can help international economic agents establish appropriate investment strategies.

The Bayesian network, based on a previously developed causal framework, has been designed to model the smaller and more frequent, attritional operational loss events. Given the limited availability of risk factor event information and operational loss data, we rely on the elicitation of subjective probabilities, sourced from domain experts. Parameter sensitivity analysis is performed to validate and check the model's robustness against the beliefs of risk management and operational staff. To ensure that the domain's evolving risk profile is captured through time, a formal approach to organizational learning is investigated that employs the automatic parameter adaption features of the Bayesian network model. A hypothetical case study is then described to demonstrate model adaption and the application of the tool to operational loss forecasting by a business unit risk manager.

Gaussian Process-Mixture Conditional Heteroscedasticity	IEEE TRANSACTIONS ON PATTERN ANALYSIS AND MACHINE INTELLIGENCE				Article						Gaussian process; Pitman-Yor process; mixture model; conditional heteroscedasticity; copula; volatility modeling	MULTIVARIATE; DISTRIBUTIONS; INFERENCE; MODELS	Generalized autoregressive conditional heteroscedasticity (GARCH) models have long been considered as one of the most successful families of approaches for volatility modeling in financial return series. In this paper, we propose an alternative approach based on methodologies widely used in the field of statistical machine learning. Specifically, we propose a novel nonparametric Bayesian mixture of Gaussian process regression models, each component of which models the noise variance process that contaminates the observed data as a separate latent Gaussian process driven by the observed data. This way, we essentially obtain a Gaussian process-mixture conditional heteroscedasticity (GPMCH) model for volatility modeling in financial return series. We impose a nonparametric prior with power-law nature over the distribution of the model mixture components, namely the Pitman-Yor process prior, to allow for better capturing modeled data distributions with heavy tails and skewness. Finally, we provide a copula-based approach for obtaining a predictive posterior for the covariances over the asset returns modeled by means of a postulated GPMCH model. We evaluate the efficacy of our approach in a number of benchmark scenarios, and compare its performance to state-of-the-art methodologies.

J	Tegnér, M; Roberts, S				Tegner, Martin; Roberts, Stephen			Probabilistic machine learning for local volatility	JOURNAL OF COMPUTATIONAL FINANCE				Article						option pricing; local volatility; probabilistic inference; Gaussian processes; machine learning	CALIBRATION	The local volatility model is widely used for pricing and hedging financial derivatives. While its main appeal is its capability of reproducing any given surface of observed option prices - it provides a perfect fit - the essential component is a latent function that can be uniquely determined only in the limit of infinite data. To (re)construct this function, numerous calibration methods have been suggested that involve steps of interpolation and extrapolation, most often of parametric form and with point-estimate representations. We use probabilistic machine learning to look at the calibration problem in a probabilistic framework based on Gaussian processes. This immediately gives a way of encoding prior beliefs about the local volatility function and a hypothesis model that is highly flexible yet not prone to overfitting. Besides providing a method for calibrating a (range of) point estimate(s), we draw posterior inference from the distribution over local volatility. This leads to a better understanding of uncertainty associated with the model in general, and with the calibration in particular. Further, we infer dynamical properties of local volatility by augmenting the hypothesis space with a time dimension. Ideally, this provides predictive distributions not only locally, but also for entire surfaces forward in time. We apply our approach to S&P 500 market data.

However, current forecasting models ignore the importance of model parameter optimisation and the use of recent data. In this article, a novel forecasting approach with a Bayesian-regularised artificial neural networks (BR-ANN) was proposed. The weight of the proposed model (BR-ANN) is determined by the particle swarm optimisation (PSO) algorithm. Daily market prices and financial technical indicators are utilised as inputs to predict the one day future closing price of the Shanghai (in China) composite index. The Bayesian-regularised network uses a probabilistic nature for the network weights and can reduce the potential for over-fitting and over-training. Our empirical study and the results of our K-line theory analysis indicate that PSO is determined to be an effective algorithm to optimise the parameters of the Bayesian neural network compared with other well-known prediction algorithms. In particular, the PSO model is more reliable than the simple Bayesian regularisation neural network near the local maximum value.

The purpose of this article is to develop an alternative Bayesian predictive model (two-parameter) which can be used to compute important risk measures that are not defined via the above predictive models. Bayesian predictive density for the Weibull-Pareto composite distribution is developed and is used to compute risk measures such as Value at Risk (VaR), Conditional Tail Expectation (CTE), Predictive Expectation (PE), Limited Predictive Expected value (LPE), Limited Predictive Variance (LPV), and Limited Predictive Tail-VaR (LPCTE). Accuracy of parameter estimates as well as the risk measures are assessed via simulation studies. It is shown that the informative Bayes estimates are consistently more accurate than ML and the non-informative Bayes estimates. Backtesting for the risk measures is performed and goodness-of-fit of Weibull-Pareto among other composite models to the Danish fire data is assessed.	[Deng, M.; Aminzadeh, M.

J	Wang, Y; Lin, T				Wang, Yan; Lin, Tong			A Novel Deterministic Probabilistic Forecasting Framework for Gold Price with a New Pandemic Index Based on Quantile Regression Deep Learning and Multi-Objective Optimization	MATHEMATICS				Article						gold price forecasting; quantile regression; probabilistic prediction models; feature screening; multi-objective optimization algorithms	NEURAL-NETWORK; ALGORITHM	The significance of precise gold price forecasting is accentuated by its financial attributes, mirroring global economic conditions, market uncertainties, and investor risk aversion. However, predicting the gold price is challenging due to its inherent volatility, influenced by multiple factors, such as COVID-19, financial crises, geopolitical issues, and fluctuations in other metals and energy prices. These complexities often lead to non-stationary time series, rendering traditional time series modeling methods inadequate. Our paper presents a multi-objective optimization algorithm that refines the interval prediction framework with quantile regression deep learning in response to this issue. This framework comprehensively responds to gold's financial market dynamics and uncertainties with a screening process of various factors, including pandemic-related indices, geopolitical indices, the US dollar index, and prices of various commodities. The quantile regression deep-learning models optimized by multi-objective optimization algorithms deliver robust, interpretable, and highly accurate predictions for handling non-linear relationships and complex data structures and enhance the overall predictive performance. The results demonstrate that the QRBiLSTM model, optimized using the MOALO algorithm, delivers excellent forecasting performance. The composite indicator AIS reaches -15.6240 and -11.5581 at 90% and 95% confidence levels, respectively. This underscores the model's high forecasting accuracy and its potential to provide valuable insights for assessing future trends in gold prices. The deterministic and probabilistic forecasting framework for gold prices captures the market dynamics with the new pandemic index and comprehensively sets a new benchmark for predictive modeling in volatile market commodities like gold.

This article first provides a computationally feasible expression for the spectral density of fGn. This expression enables us to assess the accuracy of a range of approximation methods, including the truncation method, Paxson's approximation, and the Taylor series expansion at the near-zero frequency. Next, we conduct an extensive Monte Carlo study comparing the finite sample performance and computational cost of alternative estimation methods for H under the fGn specification. These methods include two semi-parametric methods (based on the Taylor series expansion), two versions of the Whittle method (utilising either the computationally feasible expression or Paxson's approximation of the spectral density), a time-domain maximum likelihood (ML) method (employing a recursive approach for its likelihood calculation), and a change-of-frequency method. Special attention is paid to highly anti-persistent processes with H close to zero, which are of empirical relevance to financial volatility modelling. Considering the trade-off between statistical and computational efficiency, we recommend using either the Whittle ML method based on Paxson's approximation or the time-domain ML method. We model the log realized volatility dynamics of 40 financial assets in the US market from 2012 to 2019 with fBm. Although all estimation methods suggest rough volatility, the implied degree of roughness varies substantially with the estimation methods, highlighting the importance of understanding the finite sample performance of various estimation methods.

In this study, the input explanatory variables are Bayesian network nodes that are associated with learners. Training data are divided usingK-means clustering, and multiple deep learners are trained depending on the cluster. A Bayesian network is used to determine which deep learner is in charge of predicting a time series. We determine a threshold value and select learners with a posterior probability equal to or greater than the threshold value, which could facilitate more robust prediction. The proposed method is applied to financial time-series data, and the predicted results for the Nikkei 225 index are demonstrated.

Employing an ensemble strategy with diverse data modeling approaches, the method includes a pre-processing stage for variable selection, ranking their importance using statistical techniques such as OneR, Information Gain, and Chi-Square. This approach aims to overcome common challenges such as overfitting, high dimensionality, and computational efficiency, thus enhancing the robustness of the machine learning model and reducing susceptibility to biases and fluctuations. Empirical results demonstrate that, compared to the ARIMA model, the machine learning algorithm shows superior performance in forecast error and forecast hit rate and precision (R2, Willmott, and Kurtosis). Furthermore, the results suggest that the proposed algorithm can significantly improve predictive precision when applied to the ARIMA model and generalized to various datasets that include various markets and assets.

J	Li, KY; Zhou, Y				Li, Kangyi; Zhou, Yang			Improved Financial Predicting Method Based on Time Series Long Short-Term Memory Algorithm	MATHEMATICS				Article						financial capital; artificial intelligence; Bayesian POT; time series	MODEL	With developments in global economic integration and the increase in future economic uncertainty, it is imperative to have the ability to predict future capital in relation to financial capital inflow and outflow predictions to ensure capital optimization is within a controllable range within the current macroeconomic environment and situation. This paper proposes an automated capital prediction strategy for the capital supply chain using time series analysis artificial intelligence methods. Firstly, to analyze the fluctuation and tail risk of the financial characteristics, the paper explores the financial characteristics for measuring the dynamic VaR from the perspectives of volatility, tail, and peak with the Bayesian peaks over threshold (POT) model. Following this, in order to make the modeling more refined, the forecast targets are split before modeling with seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) models and Prophet models. Finally, the time series modeling of the wavelet Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model is carried out using a two-part analysis method to determine the linear separated wavelet and non-linear embedded wavelet parts to predict strong volatility in financial capital. Taking the user capital flow of the Yu'e Bao platform, the results prove the feasibility and prediction accuracy of the innovative model proposed.

Comparisons were performed on the KOSPI 200 Index options from January 2001 to December 2010. To verify the statistical differences between the compared methods, we tested the following null hypothesis: two series of forecasting errors have the same mean-squared value. The experimental study reveals that non-parametric methods significantly outperform parametric methods on both in-sample pricing and out-of-sample pricing. The outperforming non-parametric method is statistically different from the other models, and significantly different from the parametric models. The Gaussian process model delivers the most outstanding performance in forecasting, and also provides the predictive distribution of option prices. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

J	Tian, CA; Niu, T; Wei, W				Tian, Chaonan; Niu, Tong; Wei, Wei			Volatility index prediction based on a hybrid deep learning system with multi-objective optimization and mode decomposition	EXPERT SYSTEMS WITH APPLICATIONS				Article						Volatility index; Mode decomposition; Deep learning; Multi-objective optimization; Prediction	TIME-SERIES; GENETIC ALGORITHM; WIND-SPEED; NONLINEARITY; DIRECTION; NETWORKS	Advances in volatility index prediction based on computational intelligence have brought wide-ranging benefits to financial risk management. However, current studies in the field remain limited and need further improve-ment due to these research gaps: (1) ignoring the important role of probabilistic prediction in characterizing uncertainty risks; (2) relying on single-objective optimization algorithm to optimize prediction model, thereby ignoring the advantages of multi-objective optimization; (3) emphasizing nonlinear modeling, not considering both nonlinear and linear modeling simultaneously. Aiming to address these gaps, a novel multi-objective hybrid deep learning system, composed of a modified multi-objective optimizer, a clockwork recurrent neural network, and an improved mode decomposition method, is newly proposed to perform deterministic and probabilistic volatility index prediction. Concretely, the volatility index is decomposed into some modes using an advanced data decomposition method; further, the clockwork recurrent neural network is considered a prediction engine to model these modes, which has an excellent ability to model the long-term dependency for linear and nonlinear time series depending on its mechanism of temporal granularity, as compared to traditional recurrent neural networks; finally, the prediction results can be obtained by integrating the predictions from these modes, using the mode weights calculated by an improved multi-objective optimizer with the objectives of prediction accuracy and stability. To validate the performance of the proposed hybrid deep learning system, case studies and cor-responding sensitivity and convergence analyses are carried out. From the perspective of the indicator mean absolute percentage error, the maximum improvements of our proposed system reach 67.50%, 75.82%, and 75.42% in Case I, Case II, and Case III, respectively, thus indicating its superiority and practical feasibility.

Machine Learning Predictions of Housing Market Synchronization across US States: The Role of Uncertainty	JOURNAL OF REAL ESTATE FINANCE AND ECONOMICS				Article						Machine learning; Random forests; Bayesian dynamic factor model; Forecasting; Housing markets synchronization; United States	ECONOMIC-POLICY UNCERTAINTY; OIL PRICE SHOCKS; BUSINESS CYCLES; IMPACT; VOLATILITY; RETURNS; CAUSALITY; DEMAND; MODELS; OUTPUT	We analyze the role of macroeconomic uncertainty in predicting synchronization in housing price movements across all the United States (US) states plus District of Columbia (DC). We first use a Bayesian dynamic factor model to decompose the house price movements into a national, four regional (Northeast, South, Midwest, and West), and state-specific factors. We then study the ability of macroeconomic uncertainty in forecasting the comovements in housing prices, by controlling for a wide-array of predictors, such as factors derived from a large macroeconomic dataset, oil shocks, and financial market-related uncertainties. To accommodate for multiple predictors and nonlinearities, we take a machine learning approach of random forests. Our results provide strong evidence of forecastability of the national house price factor based on the information content of macroeconomic uncertainties over and above the other predictors. This result also carries over, albeit by a varying degree, to the factors associated with the four census regions, and the overall house price growth of the US economy. Moreover, macroeconomic uncertainty is found to have predictive content for (stochastic) volatility of the national factor and aggregate US house price. Our results have important implications for policymakers and investors.

By intelligently considering uncertainties on the schedule development, renewable energy systems with storage could improve dispatching accuracy, and therefore, effectively participate in electricity wholesale markets. Deterministic forecasts have been traditionally used to support dispatch planning, representing reduced or no uncertainty information about the future weather. Aiming at better representing the uncertainties involved, probabilistic forecasts have been developed to increase forecasting accuracy. For the dispatch planning, this can highly influence the development of a more precise schedule. This work extends a dispatch planning method to the use of probabilistic weather forecasts. The underlying method used a schedule optimizer coupled to a post-processing machine learning algorithm. This machine learning algorithm was adapted to include probabilistic forecasts, considering their additional information on uncertainties. This post-processing applied a calibration of the planned schedule considering the knowledge about uncertainties obtained from similar past situations. Simulations performed with a concentrated solar power plant model following the proposed strategy demonstrated promising financial improvement and relevant potential in dealing with uncertainties. Results especially show that information included in probabilistic forecasts can increase financial revenues up to 15% (in comparison to a persistence solar driven approach) if processed in a suitable way.

These properties are a consequence of their capabilities to include multiple variables and lags which, however, turns into an exponential growth of the parameters to be estimated. This means that high-dimensional models with multiple variables and lags are difficult to estimate, leading to omitted variables, information biases and a loss of potential forecasting power. Traditionally, the existing literature has resorted to factor analysis, and specially, to Bayesian methods to overcome this situation. This paper explores the so-called machine learning regularization methods as an alternative to traditional methods of forecasting and impulse response analysis. We find that regularization structures, which allow for high dimensional models, perform better than standard Bayesian methods in nowcasting and forecasting. Moreover, impulse response analysis is robust and consistent with economic theory and evidence, and with the different regularization structures. Specifically, regarding the best regularization structure, an elementwise machine learning structure performs better in nowcasting and in computational efficiency, whilst a componentwise structure performs better in forecasting and cross-validation methods.

Machine learning methods are widely implemented for crop type recognition and classification based on satellite images. However, field classification is complicated by class imbalance and aggregation of pixel-wise into field-wise forecasting. We propose here a Bayesian methodology for the aggregation of classification results. We report the comparison of class balancing techniques. We also report the comparison of classical machine learning methods and the U-Net convolutional neural network for classifying crops using a single satellite image. The best result for single-satellite-image crop classification was achieved with an overall accuracy of 77.4% and a Macro F1-score of 0.66. Bayesian aggregation for field-wise classification improved the result obtained using majority voting aggregation by 1.5%. We demonstrate here that the Bayesian aggregation approach outperforms the majority voting and averaging strategy in overall accuracy for the single-image crop classification task.

This paper focuses on predicting China's inflation within a data-rich environment. Specifically, we compile a large panel of China's monthly macroeconomic and financial variables, employing various machine learning models on this predictor panel to forecast China's inflation, encompassing both CPI and PPI, across various forecasting horizons extending up to 24 months. Our findings indicate the following: First, the machine learning models, when coupled with a large dataset of macroeconomic and financial predictors, demonstrate a superior ability to forecast China's inflation compared to benchmark time series models and principal component regression models. These advantages become even more notable at medium-to-long horizons and during periods of high inflation volatility, as well as CPI/PPI divergence periods. Second, our experiments reveal that penalized linear regression models, such as ridge and elastic net, consistently outperform the benchmarks and nonlinear machine learning methods in most cases. Lastly, variables related to price, stock, and money & credit are identified as the most crucial factors for forecasting inflation in China.

However, the lack of a comprehensive infrastructure management system incorporating bridges and pavements inhibits accurate performance prediction, optimal maintenance actions, and the associated use of shrinking budgets. This paper presents an integrated probabilistic life-cycle connectivity framework for the performance analysis of transportation networks containing bridges and asphalt pavements by considering flexural and shear failure modes for prestressed concrete and steel bridges and four failure modes, including international roughness index, rut depth, alligator cracking, and transverse cracking, for asphalt pavements. In this framework, neural network-based deep learning models are used to assess the probabilistic performance of transportation networks and to provide guidance for the associated maintenance strategies. An existing transportation network consisting of bridges and asphalt pavement segments is selected to investigate its life-cycle connectivity reliability and component importance using the matrix-based system reliability method. Results show that the consideration of asphalt pavement failure probability has a significant effect on the probability of transportation network connectivity.

In this article, we describe a novel type of heavy-tailed distribution that may be used to model data in the financial disciplines. Our proposed model, identified as a Kavya-Manoharan power Lomax (KMPLo) distribution, is thoroughly studied. Some fundamental characterizations, such as the quantile function and moments, have been developed. The maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian (B) analytical techniques are used to acquire estimates of the unknown parameters of the new model. A detailed simulation study is undertaken to evaluate the performance of the ML and B estimators. The KMPLo model's utility is demonstrated by an application to a HT insurance loss data set.

J	Zhou, M; Wang, B; Watada, J				Zhou, Min; Wang, Bo; Watada, Junzo			Deep learning-based rolling horizon unit commitment under hybrid uncertainties	ENERGY				Article						Rolling horizon unit commitment; Long short-term memory neural networks; Data-driven; Rolling forecast; Look-ahead economic dispatch	STATE-OF-CHARGE; GENETIC ALGORITHM; WIND; DISPATCH; GENERATION; LOAD; OPTIMIZATION; PENETRATION; INTEGRATION; MANAGEMENT	Unit commitment is an optimization problem in power systems, which aims to satisfy future load at minimal cost by scheduling the on/off state and output of generation resources like thermal units. One challenge herein is the uncertainties that exist in both supply and demand sides of power systems, which becomes more severe with the growing penetration of renewable energy and the popularity of diversified loads. This paper proposes a rolling horizon model for unit commitment optimization under hybrid uncertainties. First, a probabilistic forecast approach for future load and wind power is given by exploiting the advanced deep learning structures, i.e. long short-term memory neural networks. Second, a Value-at-Risk-based unit commitment model is applied to decide the on/off state and output of thermal units in the next 24 h. Then at each time window, the distributions of future load and wind power are dynamically adjusted by a rolling forecast mechanism to involve the real-time collected data, whereafter a look-ahead economic dispatch model is applied to improve the output of units. Finally, the effectiveness of this research is demonstrated by a series of experiments. Generally, this study introduces a fundamental way to integrate forecast approaches into classical unit commitment optimization models. (C) 2019 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.

EIS provides a highly generic and very accurate procedure for the Monte Carlo (MC) evaluation of high-dimensional interdependent integrals. It can be used to carry out ML-estimation of SV models as well as simulation smoothing where the latent volatilities are sampled at once. Based on this EIS simulation smoother, a Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) posterior analysis of the parameters of SV models can be performed.

To forecast conditional distribution of trade duration, this study proposes a hybrid model called "DL-ZIACD" for short, which addresses the problem of excessive zero values by a zero-inflated distribution. Meanwhile, dynamics of the distribution time-varying parameters are captured by a specially designed deep learning (DL) architecture in which the behavioral patterns of large traders and small individual traders are represented separately by different blocks. The proposed hybrid model takes advantage of the strong fitting ability of deep learning methods while allowing for providing a probabilistic output. This paper empirically applied the established model to a large-scale dataset, containing 9,900,000 transactions of the Chinese Shenzhen Stock Exchange 100 Index (SZSE 100) constituents. To the best of our knowledge, no previous studies have applied conditional duration models to a dataset of such a large scale. For both the central location forecasting and the extreme quantile forecasting, our proposed model exhibited significant superiority over the benchmark models, which indicates that our DL-ZIACD model can provide accurate forecasts in conditional duration distribution.

The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) procedure is most commonly used for estimating the unknown parameters of a GARCH model. In this study, the parameters of the GARCH models with student-t innovations are discussed for estimations using the Bayesian approach.

Lindley's approximation will be used to estimate the Bayesian estimators since they are not in a closed form. The Bayesian estimators are derived under squared error loss function. Finally, a simulation study is performed in order to compare the ML estimates to the Bayesian ones and in addition to simulations an example is given in order to illustrate the findings. MLE's and Bayesian estimates are compared according to the expected risks in the simulation study which shows that as the sample size increases the expected risks decrease and also it is observed that Bayesian estimates have performed better than MLE 's.

J	Tripathi, B; Sharma, RK				Tripathi, Bhaskar; Sharma, Rakesh Kumar			Modeling Bitcoin Prices using Signal Processing Methods, Bayesian Optimization, and Deep Neural Networks	COMPUTATIONAL ECONOMICS				Article						Time series forecasting; Deep learning; Bayesian optimization; Savitzky-Golay Filter; Outlier detection		Bitcoin is a volatile financial asset that runs on a decentralized peer-to-peer Blockchain network. Investors need accurate price forecasts to minimize losses and maximize profits. Extreme volatility, speculative nature, and dependence on intrinsic and external factors make Bitcoin price forecast challenging. This research proposes a reliable forecasting framework by reducing the inherent noise in Bitcoin time series and by examining the predictive power of three distinct types of predictors, namely fundamental indicators, technical indicators, and univariate lagged prices. We begin with a three-step hybrid feature selection procedure to identify the variables with the highest predictive ability, then use Hampel and Savitzky-Golay filters to impute outliers and remove signal noise from the Bitcoin time series. Next, we use several deep neural networks tuned by Bayesian Optimization to forecast short-term prices for the next day, three days, five days, and seven days ahead intervals. We found that the Deep Artificial Neural Network model created using technical indicators as input data outperformed other benchmark models like Long Short Term Memory, Bi-directional LSTM (BiLSTM), and Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)-BiLSTM. The presented results record a high accuracy and outperform all existing models available in the past literature with an absolute percentage error as low as 0.28% for the next day forecast and 2.25% for the seventh day for the latest out of sample period ranging from Jan 1, 2021, to Nov 1, 2021. With contributions in feature selection, data-preprocessing, and hybridizing deep learning models, this work contributes to researchers and traders in fundamental and technical domains.

J	Lux, T				Lux, Thomas			The Markov-switching multifractal model of asset returns: GMM estimation and linear forecasting of volatility	JOURNAL OF BUSINESS & ECONOMIC STATISTICS				Article						generalized method of moments; Levinson-Durbin algorithm; long memory; multiplicative; volatility model	FINITE-SAMPLE PROPERTIES; GENERALIZED-METHOD; LONG-MEMORY; MOMENTS	Multifractal processes have recently been proposed as a new formalism for modeling the time series of returns in finance. The major attraction of these processes is their ability to generate various degrees of long memory in different powers of returns-a feature that has been found in virtually all financial data. Initial difficulties stemming from nonstationarity and the combinatorial nature of the original model have been overcome by the introduction of an iterative Markov-switching multifractal model which allows for estimation of its parameters via maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian forecasting of volatility. However, applicability of MLE is restricted to cases with a discrete distribution of volatility components. From a practical point of view, ML also becomes computationally unfeasible for large numbers of components even if they are drawn from a discrete distribution. Here we propose an alternative generalized method of moments (GMM) estimator together with linear forecasts which in principle is applicable for any continuous distribution with any number of volatility components. Monte Carlo studies show that GMM performs reasonably well for the popular binomial and lognormal models and that the loss incurred with linear compared to optimal forecasts is small. Extending the number of volatility components beyond what is feasible with MLE leads to gains in forecasting accuracy for some time series.

Data from publicly traded Brazilian companies in 2019 were obtained. We used text analysis to assess the cognitive biases from the qualitative reports of analysts. Further, we analyzed the data using statistical regression learning methods and statistical classification learning methods, such as Multiple Linear Regression (MRL), k-dependence Bayesian (k-DB), and Random Forest (RF). The Bayesian inference and classification methods allow an expansion of the research line, especially in the area of machine learning, which can benefit from the examples of factors addressed in this research. The results indicated that, among cognitive biases, optimism had a negative relationship with forecasting accuracy while anchoring bias had a positive relationship. Commonality, to a lesser extent, also had a positive relationship with the analyst's accuracy. Among financial factors, the most important aspects in the accuracy of analysts were volatility, indebtedness, and profitability. Age of the company, fair value, American Depositary Receipts (ADRs), performance, and loss were still important but on a smaller scale. The results of the RF models showed a greater explanatory power. This research sheds light on the cognitive as well as financial aspects that influence the analyst's accuracy, jointly using text analysis and machine learning methods, capable of improving the explanatory power of predictive models, together with the use of training models followed by testing.

The parameters of BMSM-Skewed t model can be estimated by Maximum Likelihood (ML) methods, and volatility forecasting can be accomplished via Bayesian updating. In order to evaluate the performance of BMSM-Skewed t model, BMSM model with Normal innovations (BMSM-N), BMSM model with Student-t innovations (BMSM-t) and GARCH(1,1) models (GARCH-N, GARCH-t and GARCH-Skewed t) are chosen for comparison. Through empirical studies on Shanghai Stock Exchange Composite Index (SSEC), we find that for sample estimation, BMSM models outperform the GARCH(1,1) models through BIC and AIC rules, and BMSM-Skewed t performs the best among all the models due to its fat tails, skewness and multifractality. In addition, BMSM-Skewed t model dominates other models at most forecasting horizons for out-of-sample volatility forecasts in terms of MSE, MAE and SPA test. (C) 2016 Elsevier B.V.

At the first step, we embed the high-dimensional time series into a reduced low-dimensional space using nonlinear manifold learning (local linear embedding and parsimonious diffusion maps). Then, we construct reduced-order surrogate models on the manifold (here, for our illustrations, we used multivariate autoregressive and Gaussian process regression models) to forecast the embedded dynamics. Finally, we solve the pre-image problem, thus lifting the embedded time series back to the original high-dimensional space using radial basis function interpolation and geometric harmonics. The proposed numerical data-driven scheme can also be applied as a reduced-order model procedure for the numerical solution/propagation of the (transient) dynamics of partial differential equations (PDEs). We assess the performance of the proposed scheme via three different families of problems: (a) the forecasting of synthetic time series generated by three simplistic linear and weakly nonlinear stochastic models resembling electroencephalography signals, (b) the prediction/propagation of the solution profiles of a linear parabolic PDE and the Brusselator model (a set of two nonlinear parabolic PDEs), and (c) the forecasting of a real-world data set containing daily time series of ten key foreign exchange rates spanning the time period 3 September 2001-29 October 2020.

However, traditional replenishment strategies often struggle to meet the complex and ever-changing demands of real-world warehouse scenarios. Moreover, the spatiotemporal heterogeneity of commodity demand and inventory cost poses significant challenges to time series prediction models, as individual training strategies for different commodities significantly increase modeling and time costs. To address these issues, we propose a replenishment model called IACPPO, which incorporates the Advantage ActorCritic (A2C) algorithm with the Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO) algorithm. Firstly, we introduce gated recurrent unit (GRU) and Attention Mechanisms into the Actor-Critic network to analyze data state spaces for probabilistic modeling and extracting valid information from environmental state sequences by memory reasoning and focusing on critical state sequences; additionally, we fuse the A2C algorithm with the PPO algorithm to train the whole network simultaneously to obtain the replenishment strategy. Finally, experimental results on two different real-world inventory datasets show that using the IACPPO model has achieved the best cost control strategies in most experimental validations of replenishment strategies.

J	Ahmed, T; Srivastava, A				Ahmed, Tanveer; Srivastava, Abhishek			Combining humans and machines for the future: A novel procedure to predict human interest	FUTURE GENERATION COMPUTER SYSTEMS-THE INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF ESCIENCE				Article						Human machine systems; Data analytics; Interest modeling; Machine learning; Stochastic volatility models; Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process	RECOGNITION; OPTIONS; RECALL	This paper proposes a method to quantify interest. In common terminology, when we engage with an object, e.g. Online Games, Social Networking Websites, Mobile Apps, etc., there is a degree of interest between us and the object. But, owing to the lack of a procedure that can quantify interest, we are unable to tell by how 'much' of a factor are we interested in the object. In other words, can we find a number for someone's interest? In this article, we propose a method that uses the principle of Bayesian Inference to tackle this issue. We formulate the "interest estimation problem" as a state estimation problem to deduce interest (in any object) indirectly from user activity. Activity caused by interest is computed through a subjective-objective weighted approach, then using indirect inference rules, we provide numerical estimates of interest. To do that, we model the dynamics of interest through the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. To further enhance the base performance, we draw inspiration from Stochastic Volatility models from Finance. Subsequently, drawing upon a self-adapting transfer function, we provide an avant-garde statistical procedure to model the transformation of interest into activity. The individual contributions are then combined and a solution is provided via Particle filters. Validation of the method is done in two ways. (1) Experimentation is performed on real datasets. Through numerical investigation we have found that the method shows good performance. (2) We implement the framework as a Web application and deploy it on an Enterprise Service Bus. The framework has been successfully hosted on a Cloud based Virtualized testbed consisting of several Virtual Machines constructed over XENServer as the underlying hypervisor. Through this experimental setup, we show the efficacy of the proposed algorithm in estimating interest, at much the same time, we demonstrate the viability of the method in practical cloud based deployment scenarios.

J	Marvin, HJP; Bouzembrak, Y				Marvin, Hans J. P.; Bouzembrak, Yamine			A system approach towards prediction of food safety hazards: Impact of climate and agrichemical use on the occurrence of food safety hazards	AGRICULTURAL SYSTEMS				Article						Food supply chain; Bayesian Networks; Dairy and milk; Feed; Machine learning	BAYESIAN BELIEF NETWORKS; MYCOTOXINS; SENSITIVITY; DRIVERS; MAIZE; FRAUD	In this study, we aimed to demonstrate the aptness of a system approach to predict the level of contamination in a given agricultural product. As a showcase, the impact of climate and agrichemical use on the occurrence of food safety hazards in feed of dairy cows in the Netherlands was used. Data on chemical hazards in dairy cows' feed in the Netherlands for the years 2000 to 2013 were retrieved from the Dutch monitoring program KAP (Quality Program for Agricultural Products). Climate data (17 variables) and agrichemical usage figs. (6 variables) for the Netherlands were obtained from the NOAA's National Centers for Environmental Information, the European Commission Joint Research Center's Agri4Cast database, and FAO's FAOSTAT. A Bayesian Network (BN) was constructed with this data and optimized for the prediction of the contamination level. The overall accuracy of prediction of the level of contamination in feed was 90.3%. Sensitivity analysis demonstrated that many climate and agrichemical variables contributed to the prediction; however, their individual contribution was generally small. The applicability of the BN was demonstrated in more detail for grass and maize as feed components. The observed trends in contamination of these crops were accounted for by climate and agrichemical variables, with the impact varying amongst the specific variables and commodities. The variables with the highest impact were "days of precipitations in a month with >= 2.5 mm" and "annual use of herbicides". The results demonstrate that data-driven BNs can capture complex interactions, thereby enabling high-accuracy predictions. Whilst the applicability of this approach to the safety of dairy cows' feed in the Netherlands has thus been demonstrated, it can also be applied to other areas of food safety when a systems approach is needed. Such models can support risk assessors and risk managers in their understanding of the impacts of a given factor on food and feed safety, and inform the latter's decisions to mitigate potential risks.

The oil, and gold as well have experienced a downward trend due to the increased rate in the number of confirmed COVID-19 cases. Lately, the published COVID data comprised new variables that may influence the accuracy of the oil/gold prices forecasting models including the Stringency index, Reproduction rate, Positive Rate, and Vaccinations. In this study, Deep Autoencoders are introduced and combined with the well-known approach: Pearson Correlation Coefficient, PCC, analysis in selecting the key features that affect the accuracy of the forecasting models of gold and oil prices with respect to COVID-19 pandemic. We have utilized a hybrid approach of PCC along with a 2-Stage Stacked Autoencoder, SA, to extract the latent features which are then submitted to Neural Network, NN, regression model. The NN regressor has been trained using the Bayesian Regularization-backpropagation algorithm which provides a good generalization for small noisy datasets. The hybrid approach has yielded the minimum MSE values of 8.97 x 10(-3) and 5.356 x 10(-2) on the oil/gold validation set, respectively. Compared to the existing approaches, the proposed approach has outperformed the ARIMA, ML based regression models in forecasting the oil/gold prices. In addition, the introduced framework has yielded lower Mean Absolute Error, MAE, than the Recurrent Neural Network, RNN, and the Principal Component Analysis, PCA, for dimension reduction. The retrieved results showed that the hybrid method produced more robust features by considering the relationship between the input features.
